Can I register to vote?

To register to vote in California, you must be:
• A United States citizen living in California
• 18 years of age or older on Election Day
• Not currently imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony (for more information on the rights of people who have been incarcerated, please see the Secretary of State's Voting Rights for Californians with Criminal Convictions or Detained in Jail or Prison)

How do I register to vote?

  On the web at registertovote.ca.gov
• If you have a California driver license or identification card number, you can authorize use of that signature for the registration form.  Fill out the online application and simply hit “submit” at the end. 
• If there is no signature on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles, you will need to
o enter your date of birth and last four digits of your social security number
o click “print”
o sign the paper application
o mail it to the address provided
o No printer? Go ahead and click “I don’t have the ability to print” and your county elections official will mail you a form to sign and return.

  By calling 800.345.VOTE (800.345.8683) and asking to have a voter registration form sent to your home.

    By picking up an official registration postcard from your county elections office, any  DMV office, or a public library, post office, public assistance office, or any government   office that serves the disabled.

It is important that your voter registration application be filled out completely and be submitted online no later than midnight 15 days before the election; or postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election.  If you miss the deadline your application will still be processed, and if approved, you will be able to vote in future elections.

What’s next?

If time permits, your county elections official will contact you when your voter registration application is approved or if more information is needed to confirm your eligibility.   You can check with your county election office to make sure you’re registered. Find county contact information here: Check Status of Your Voter Registration.

What if sharing my address could put me in a life-threatening situation?

You may qualify for the Safe At Home confidential address program. Please do not apply to register to vote using the online site. Contact the Safe At Home program toll-free at (877) 322-5227 or by the Safe At Home email.

What is a permanent vote-by-mail voter?

When you register you will have the option to have vote by mail ballots automatically sent to you for every election.  If you are already registered, you may also contact your County Elections Office to ask how to change your status to be a permanent vote-by-mail voter.

 
Once I am registered to vote do I ever have to register again?

You must reregister if you:
• move your address
• change your name 
• wish to change political party affiliation 
• were removed from the registration rolls while in prison or on parole for the conviction of a felony

Do I have to register as a member of a political party?

You may either register as a member of a political party (Republican, Democratic, Green, etc.) or you may choose not to state a party preference. Your choice between registering as a party member or as a no-party-preference voter may affect whether or not you’re allowed to vote in a primary election to choose a candidate to run for a political party in the general election.

What if I am in the military and overseas voter, or I live abroad?

Military and overseas voters are United States citizens who are members of the Uniformed Services (on active duty) and their eligible dependents, members of the Merchant Marine and their eligible dependents, commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or United States citizens residing outside the United States. To apply to register to vote, receive your elections materials, and vote, you must apply for a special absentee ballot by filling out the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA).


What if I am a college student?

As a Californian living away from home while attending a college, trade school or technical school, you may choose to register to vote using either the home away from home address you use while at school, or your traditional home address.

Choosing which address to use when you register to vote is a personal decision. Whatever you decide, you may not register to vote in two places during the same election cycle.

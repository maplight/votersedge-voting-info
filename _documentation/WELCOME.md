@TODO -- update this and finalize it... this is a DRAFT!!!

**Greetings Voting information content writers!**

We are so happy that you are writing or translating content for the Voting Information section of Voter’s Edge for your state and region or county. 

All of this content will appear in the Voting Info section of Voter’s Edge, reaching potentially millions of people in your state as they research their ballot information. The content of this site will be Creative Commons licensed, and we want it to be really useful, voter-centric, easy to understand and not overwhelming.

## CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

We have some guidelines for you, and a few ways to share your content, which will help streamline getting your information online. For this first pass, we will accept your contributions following the guidelines mentioned below, and then later share with you the method and workflow for updating and editing your contributions.

There are a few things you can do that will help us get your content in order.

* TEMPLATE: Please use the provided template for your files. 

* PLAIN LANGUAGE: Please write in plain-language, and keep your text short, friendly, approachable and to the point. Not only is this better for everyone, but also please remember that this will also help because we are translating content for California into Spanish.

* FORMATTING: We would prefer if you could use Markdown or plain HTML with these tags: h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, table, image, a, ul, ol, strong, em. But most of all, we want to get rolling with the content, so at the very least, please share your writing with us and we will convert it to our format & then share with you the method for contributing updates and edits later on.

* IMAGES: If there are images that are informational, please include them. These images are subject to editorial & design revision, but it is helpful to know if there is necessary content in the imagery. We will update our style guide after seeing what kind of images you would like to include.

* SECTIONS: We have 8 sections right now. You may contribute content to subsections in these categories.
  * 'where-to-vote' 
  * 'register-to-vote'
  * 'how-to-vote'
  * 'when-to-vote'
  * 'important-dates-deadlines'
  * 'voting-basics'
  * 'my-rights-as-a-voter'
  * 'other-topics'

* STATEWIDE VOTING INFO: Any content that applies to all of california should go in the 'en/ca/statewide' folder. Content will go in the appropriate section folder.

* COUNTIES: If you are adding information about your county, please include your county name. Ideally, it would be in a folder labeled like this: alameda_county, alpine_county, etc.  Content will go in the appropriate section folder.

* TRANSLATIONS: Our translators will be using a similar structure to edit all of the voting information files.

* PREVIEW CONTENT: Content editors will be able to preview the voting guides. We are identifying our content crew and will provide you with materials to edit and update the content.



## SHARING FILES
You will get an email from your state voting information coordinator with instructions on how to share and edit your content.

## CONTENT EDITORS & TRANSLATORS
If you expect (or want to be) to be a major content editor or translator, we can sign you up for training on our repository & webinar training with our publishing system. 


## STYLE GUIDE
We are creating a style guide, and your feedback on this will be invaluable. We are testing our information organization in December and will finalize the format and then be able to set up the best and simplest system that works for our teams.

We are creating a public repository of all of the voting information. This is the "master document" which accepts changes from everyone. https://github.com/maplight/votersedge-voting-info



### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple language for formatting text for the web. It uses simple formatting like **this should be bold** to write. Here are the formatting tips. https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

If you would prefer to use a tool that will format it for you with a button, this free-online tool that allows you to write markdown formatted text. https://stackedit.io/editor 


All you really need to write Markdown is a text editor (*not microsoft word!*)
There are other tools such as Mou, Retext.

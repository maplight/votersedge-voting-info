## How do I vote if I am in the military or overseas?  

Anyone serving in the military or living outside the U.S. whose last U.S. residence was in New York, along with their spouses and/or dependents, may register as a military or special federal voter in New York. (See [How do I register if I am in the military or overseas?](#item-register-military-overseas) for details on how to register and receive your ballot.)  

To cast your vote, you must return your ballot to your local [board of elections office](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html) by postal mail. Your ballot must be postmarked no later than the day before the election and must be received by the board of elections no later than seven days after the election.  

If you have requested your absentee ballot, but have not received it, you may download and use the [Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot](https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fwab2013.pdf) and return that by mail to your local board of elections.  

You may also track your ballot using New York Stateâ€™s [military and overseas ballot tracking website](https://ny.secureballotusa.com/NY_loginSelection.action) to verify when your ballot has been received by your local board of elections.

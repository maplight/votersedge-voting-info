If you are voting in New York City, make sure you know your poll site address and your **Election District (ED)** and **Assembly District (AD)** numbers. You can get this information using the [BOEâ€™s Poll Site Locator](https://nyc.pollsitelocator.com/search) and entering your address. Sign in at the correct table for your AD/ED (these numbers appear on a sign over each table) and get your ballot from the poll worker. See step-by-step instructions for completing and scanning your ballot [here](http://www.nyccfb.info/nyc-votes/how-to-vote).

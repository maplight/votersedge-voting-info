NYC residents can register online through the [New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) website](https://voterreg.dmv.ny.gov/MotorVoter/). You will need to set up a profile with a valid NYS driver license (or non-driver ID) number and your social security number to begin.  

You can fill out a voter registration form and submit it in person or by mail to the NYC Board of Elections. You can download forms in Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, Greek, Haitian Creole, Italian, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, Urdu, and Yiddish [here](http://www.nyccfb.info/nyc-votes/registering).

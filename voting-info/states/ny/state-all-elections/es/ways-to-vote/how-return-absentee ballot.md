After completing your absentee ballot, you will need to mail it to your local [board of elections office](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html). To have your absentee ballot counted, it must be postmarked **no later than the day before the election** and the board of elections must receive it **no later than 7 days after the election.**  

**You may also return your absentee ballot to your local board of elections office in person,** starting as soon as ballots are available (i.e., 32 days prior to the election). You may deliver your ballot to the board of elections office Monday through Friday and on the weekend prior to Election Day, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and until 9 p.m. on Election Day.

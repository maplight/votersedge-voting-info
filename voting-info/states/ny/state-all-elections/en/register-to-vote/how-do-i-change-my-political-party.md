If you are a registered voter who wishes to join a political party for the first time, or change your political party membership, complete and submit a new voter registration form. Your change of enrollment must be received no later than 25 days prior to the general election before the primary in which you wish to vote (generally that means in October of the previous year).  Check the [New York State Board of Elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingDeadlines.html) and your local [board of elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html) websites for registration deadlines for particular elections.

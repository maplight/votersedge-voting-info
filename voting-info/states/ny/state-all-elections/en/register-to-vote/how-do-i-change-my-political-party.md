If you are a registered voter who wished to join a political party or change your political party membership, submit an updated New York State Voter Registration Form. Your change of enrollment must be received no later than 25 days prior to the general election the year **before** you wish to vote in a primary. (Why so early? This system was put into place to prevent voters from switching their party registrations shortly before a contested primary.)

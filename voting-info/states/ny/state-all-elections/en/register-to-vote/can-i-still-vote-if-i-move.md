**Can I vote if I am registered and I move within the state of New York?**  
If you move within the state of New York, you must provide notice of the change in your address by submitting an updated New York State Voter Registration Form with your new address. The notice of your change of address must be received by your local [board of elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html) **at least 20 days before the election** in which you wish to vote.

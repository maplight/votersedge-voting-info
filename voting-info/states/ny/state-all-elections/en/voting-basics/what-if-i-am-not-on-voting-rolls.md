If your name is not found in the poll book when you sign in to vote, make sure you are signing in at the correct polling location. A poll worker will be available at your polling location to assist you in determining which district you live in if you need assistance.

Once you confirm that you are at the correct polling location, if you name is not in the poll book and you believe that you are eligible, you can still vote. Ask a poll worker for an affidavit ballot, and follow the instructions. After the election, the board of elections will check its records, and your vote will be counted if you were eligible to vote and the ballot and envelope were filled out correctly. If not, you will receive a notice that you were not eligible to vote, and your affidavit ballot envelope will serve as your voter registration form for the next election.

An affidavit ballot is a paper ballot and envelope that you complete and give to a poll worker (it does not go in the scanner and is not counted immediately). It is generally used when your name is not in the poll book at your polling site. After the election, your Board of Elections will check its records and your vote will be counted if you were eligible to vote, were at the correct poll site, and filled out the ballot and the envelope correctly. If not, you will receive a notice that your vote did not count.   In New York City, your affidavit envelope serves as a registration form; outside the city, you may receive a registration form so you can register for future elections.

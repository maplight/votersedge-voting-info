When you arrive at your designated polling place, sign in tot he poll book and get your ballot and voting instructions from a poll worker. Make sure to mark your ballot completely, according to the instructions.  

Only vote for one person per office, unless instructed otherwise. For some offices, your ballot will say “Vote for any TWO” or “Vote for any THREE.” **Read your ballot carefully** so you do not overvote or undervote.

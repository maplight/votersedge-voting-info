**What are my rights as a voter in the state of New York?**  

You have the right to vote in a primary election if you are a registered voter and you are enrolled in the political party that is holding the primary.  

You have the right to vote in a general election if you are a registered voter and appear inside your polling place no later than 9 p.m. on Election Day. (See [Ways to Vote](#section-ways-to-vote) for details on alternate methods of voting.)  

In any election you have the following rights as a New York voter:  
- Be assisted by any person of your choice (except your employer or union representative), including a trained poll worker, if you need help to vote. If you need an interpreter, BOE interpreters are available to assist voters at selected sites. Call 866-VOTE-NYC for more information, including which polling sites have interpreters available and for which languages.  
- Ask election workers how to vote.  
- Bring materials with you.  
- Vote even if the voting machine is broken.  
- Vote by "affidavit ballot' if your name is missing from the list of voters at your polling site.

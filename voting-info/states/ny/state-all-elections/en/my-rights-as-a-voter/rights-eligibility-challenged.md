If your name is missing from the list of registered voters in your precinct, you are entitled to cast an affidavit ballot. (See [What if I am not on the voting rolls at polling place?](#menu-item-what-if-i-am-not-on-voting-rolls)). If a poll worker challenges your eligibility to vote for any other reason, you may swear an oath under penalty of perjury and vote normally.

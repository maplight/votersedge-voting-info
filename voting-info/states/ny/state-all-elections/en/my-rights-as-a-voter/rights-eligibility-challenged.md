If your name is missing from the list of registered voters in your precinct, or if the election judge challenges your eligibility to vote for any reason, you are entitled to cast an affidavit ballot. (See [What if I am not on the voting rolls at polling place?](#item-what-if-i-am-not-on-voting-rolls))

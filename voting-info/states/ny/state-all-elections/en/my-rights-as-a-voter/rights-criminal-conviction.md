**Does a misdemeanor conviction affect my right to register and vote?**  

You can register and vote, even from jail, if you have been convicted of only a misdemeanor. The same rules apply whether you were convicted in a New York court, another stateâ€™s court, or a federal court. You do not need to provide any documentation about your criminal record in order to register and vote. (See [Ways to Vote](#section-ways-to-vote) for more information.)  

**Does a felony conviction affect my right to register and vote in New York State?**  

You may **not** register or vote if you have been convicted of a felony and for that felony:
- You are currently incarcerated, or  
- You are under parole supervision.  

You **may** register and vote if you were convicted of a felony and for that felony:  
- You were sentenced to probation;  
- You were not sentenced to incarceration or your prison sentence was suspended;  
- You have served your maximum prison sentence, **in which case you are able to re-register to vote;**  
- You were on parole and then discharged, **in which case you are able to re-register to vote;** or  
- You have received a pardon.  

Note that if you were previously registered to vote, you must re-register once you are elibible. (See [Register to Vote](#section-register-to-vote) for more information.)

Voters who require assistance in voting due to blindness, disability or inability to read or write may receive assistance from a person of the voter’s choice; this person cannot be an officer or agent of the voter’s employer or union. Jurisdictions must take steps to make the registration and voting process accessible to the elderly and to individuals with disabilities.  

In New York City, any voter can ask to use a ballot marking device (BMD) to make it easier to mark your ballot. The BMD allows you to view the ballot on a display screen or listen to it through audio headphones, and to mark it using the touch screen, a braille keypad, a sip & puff device, or a rocker paddle. For voters outside the city, check with your county Board of Elections regarding assistance available for the disabled.

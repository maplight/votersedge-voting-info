Voters who require assistance in voting due to blindness, disability or inability to read or write may receive assistance from a person of the voter’s choice; this person cannot be an officer or agent of the voter’s employer or union. Jurisdictions must take steps to make the registration and voting process accessible to the elderly and to individuals with disabilities.

If you move within New York, you must update your voter registration within 25 days of moving. See [Can I vote if I am registered and I move within the state of New York?](#menu-item-Can-I-vote-if-I-am-registered-and-I-move-within-the-state-of-New York?) for instructions on how to change your voter registration.

If you have moved in the last 25 days, notice of your change of address must be received by your local [board of elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html) **no later than June 8** if you wish to vote in the federal primary on June 28.

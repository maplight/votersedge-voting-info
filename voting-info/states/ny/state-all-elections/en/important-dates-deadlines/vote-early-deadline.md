New York State does not have early voting, except by [absentee ballot](#menu-item-Am-I-eligible-to-vote-by-absentee-ballot?). You may vote on Election Day at your designated polling place or via absentee ballot, by mail or in person, at any time between receiving your ballot and Election Day. (See [Ways to Vote](#section-ways-to-vote) for more information.)

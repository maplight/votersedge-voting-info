Dedicated and well-trained poll workers are essential to the smooth functioning of democracy. You can become a poll worker if you are a registered voter and a resident of the county in which you want to be a poll worker (or, in the case of New York City, a city resident). You will be obligated to work a few days a year when your county or city holds elections, and you will be paid a small stipend by your board of elections.  

Poll workers have the following responsibilities on Election Day:  
- Prepare the polling place for voting  
- Set up voting equipment  
- Process voters  
- Demonstrate voting procedures to voters  
- Provide assistance when requested by voters  
- Canvass and report election results  
- Close the polling place  

If you are interested in becoming a poll worker, you can contact the State Board of Elections [here](http://www.elections.ny.gov/BecomePollworker.html). New York City voters can [apply online](https://nyc.electiondayworker.com/r/rA_4yzXNYkmL7ahEXYi0dw#.V1HNfvkrKUk) or [download an application](http://vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/forms/boe/pollworkers/PollworkerApplication.pdf) on the NYC Board of Elections website.

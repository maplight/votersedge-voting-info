If you make a mistake while marking your ballot, you may return your ballot to a poll worker and ask for a new ballot. You may receive up to two additional ballots in order to mark your ballot as you intended. Ballots that are returned to the poll worker for this reason are marked "VOID" by and are placed in a special envelope. Votes on these void ballots will not be counted.

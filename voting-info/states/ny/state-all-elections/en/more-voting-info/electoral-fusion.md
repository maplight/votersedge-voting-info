**What is electoral fusion, or fusion voting?**  

New York permits a process known as electoral fusion, which means that multiple political parties may support the same candidate. This frequently results in one candidate appearing multiple times on a single ballot for the same office. You may only vote for a given candidate once, but you may choose which party to vote for. For example, if a candidate is supported by both the Republican Party and the Libertarian Party, their name will appear on the ballot twice. You may choose to vote for either one, and your vote will be counted as supporting that candidate, but you may not vote for them both as a Republican and as a Libertarian.

**New York’s 95 delegates to the Republican National Convention will be allocated based on the district-level and statewide presidential preference vote results.**  

Eighty-one delegates are district-level delegates---three for each of New York’s 27 congressional districts. The first place finisher in a district will receive two of that district’s delegates, and the second place finisher will receive one delegate. A candidate must win at least 20 percent of the vote in a district in order to be eligible to receive a share of that district’s delegates. If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote in a district, they will receive all of that district’s delegates.  

Eleven of New York’s delegates will serve at-large and will be allocated on a proportional basis; a candidate must win at least 20 percent of the statewide vote in order to be eligible to receive a share of the state's at-large delegates. If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the statewide vote, he or she will receive all of the state's at-large delegates.  

The remaining three of New York’s delegates are national party leaders; they will be required to pledge their support to the winner of the state’s primary.

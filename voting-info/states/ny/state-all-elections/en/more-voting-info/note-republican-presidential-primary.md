**In addition to their presidential preference, Democratic primary voters vote for 148 of New York’s 291 delegates to the Democratic National Convention.**  

Delegates do not appear on Voter’s Edge, but they will appear on the Democratic primary ballot. Delegates are bound to the candidate for whom they have stated their support on the ballot. A candidate must receive at least 15 percent of the presidential preference vote in order to receive any delegates in a congressional district.  

The remainder of New York’s Democratic delegates are apportioned as follows: 30 are pledged party leaders and elected officials, 49 are pledged at-large delegates, and 19 are pledged alternates. These delegates are allocated proportionally based on statewide primary results.  

An additional 44 party leaders and elected officials serve as unpledged delegates and are not required to adhere to the results of the state primary.

A political party is a group of people who try to determine public policy and influence government by getting their candidates elected to office.  

Any political party may hold a primary and nominate candidates for the general election in New York, and candidates are permitted to run for office as a nominee of multiple political parties. (See [What is electoral fusion?](#menu-item-electoral-fusion) below.)

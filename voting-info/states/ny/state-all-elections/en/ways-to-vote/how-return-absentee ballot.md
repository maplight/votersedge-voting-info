After completing your absentee ballot, you will need to mail or hand delivery it to your local [board of elections office](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html). To have your mailed absentee ballot counted, it must be postmarked **no later than the day before the election** and the board of elections must receive it **no later than 7 days after the election.**  

**If you return your absentee ballot to your local board of elections office in person,** you may do so starting as soon as ballots are available (i.e., 32 days prior to the election). You may deliver your ballot to the board of elections office Monday through Friday.

Applications for absentee ballots are available to be picked up in person at your local [board of elections office](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html). Alternatively, you can download a PDF version of the New York State Ballot Application Form in [English](http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/download/voting/Absentee06152010.pdf) or [Spanish](http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/download/voting/Absentee2012-Spanish.pdf) from the New York State Board of Elections. New York City voters can also download an absentee ballot application in [Bengali](http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/forms/boe/absenteevoting/absbengali.pdf), [Chinese](http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/forms/boe/absenteevoting/abschinese.pdf), or [Korean](http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/forms/boe/absenteevoting/abskorean.pdf).  

You may also request an absentee ballot by mail by sending a letter to your local board of elections. The letter must be received by your local board of elections **no earlier than 30 days and no later than 7 days before Election Day** and must include the following information:  
- Your address where you are registered to vote  
- The address where you want your absentee ballot to be sent  
- Your reason for requesting an absentee ballot  
- Your signature as it appears on your voter registration  

In response to your letter the BOE will send an application along with your ballot.  For your ballot to count, the application must be completely filled out. If you cannot pick up your ballot, or will not be able to receive it by mail, you may designate someone to pick it up for you on your ballot application. Only the person designated on your application will be permitted to pick up and deliver your ballot.  

If the deadline for requesting an absentee ballot by mail has passed and you cannot appear at your poll site on Election Day because of an accident or sudden illness, you may send a representative to your local [board of elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html) with a written letter of authorization to receive an absentee ballot on your behalf. A completed application and your completed ballot must be returned to the board of elections office by the close of polls on Election Day.

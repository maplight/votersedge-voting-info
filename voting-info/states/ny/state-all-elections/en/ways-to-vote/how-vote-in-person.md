If you are newly registered to vote, you should receive a voter card in the mail 2-3 weeks after registering that contains your polling location information. You can also check [My Polling Place](#section-my-polling-place) to find your polling location. In August of each year, all registered voters receive a mailing with information about the state/local primary and general elections, including their poll site location.  

New York City voters can confirm their poll site information at [nyc.pollsitelocator.com](nyc.pollsitelocator.com). Outside New York City, your poll site location can be confirmed using the [New York State voter lookup service](https://voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us/).  

To vote in person on Election Day, go to your designated polling location before 9 p.m. Poll opening times vary by election and county; contact your local [board of elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html).  

Once you arrive at your polling place, follow these steps to obtain and submit your ballot:  
1. **Sign an application for your ballot.** A poll worker will determine the ballot on which you are qualified to vote, initial it, and direct you to a voting or privacy booth.  
2. **Mark your ballot.** Each jurisdiction in New York uses its own voting system from among the systems approved by the New York State Board of Elections. (For more information about voting machines, refer to the [New York State Board of Elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingMachines.html) website.) Follow the instructions to mark your ballot, and remember that you are entitled to assistance from a trained poll worker. Pay special attention to the number of candidates to vote for in each office.  
3. **Check your ballot.** Double-check that you have chosen the candidates you intended to vote for and marked your ballot according to the instructions.  
4. **Cast your ballot.** Follow the instructions to submit your completed ballot either by inserting it into the scanner or by taking your ballot, in a security envelope, to a poll worker.

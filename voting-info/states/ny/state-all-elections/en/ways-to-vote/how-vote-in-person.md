If you are newly registered to vote, you should receive a voter card in the mail 2-3 weeks after registering that contains your polling location information. You can also check [My Polling Place](#section-my-polling-place) to find your polling location.  

To vote in person on Election Day, go to your designated polling location between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Once you arrive at your polling place, follow these steps to obtain and submit your ballot:  
1. **Sign an application for your ballot.** A poll worker will determine the ballot on which you are qualified to vote, initial it, and direct you to a voting booth.  
2. **Mark your ballot.** Each jurisdiction in New York uses its own voting system from among the systems approved by the New York State Board of Elections. (For more information about voting machines, refer to the [New York State Board of Elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingMachines.html) website.) Follow the instructions to mark your ballot, and remember that you are entitled to assistance from a trained poll worker. Pay special attention to the number of candidates to vote for in each office.  
3. **Check your ballot.** Double-check that you have chosen the candidates you intended to vote for and marked your ballot according to the instructions.  
4. **Cast your ballot.** Follow the instructions to submit your completed ballot either electronically or by taking your ballot, in a security envelope, to a poll worker to add to the ballot box.

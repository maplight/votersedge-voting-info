The in-person voter registration deadline for the [2016 New York State Special Election](http://www.nyccfb.info/about/calendar/new-york-state-special-election) is Saturday, April 9, 2016.  

To register to vote in person, you must go to your borough's [Board of Elections office](http://vote.nyc.ny.us/html/contact/offices.shtml) between the hours of 9:00am to 5:00pm.  

Under New York State Election Law, to vote in the presidential primary, you must be a newly registered Republican or Democrat (registered between October 10, 2015 and March 25, 2016) or if you were previously registered to vote, you must have registered as a Republican or Democrat no later than October 9, 2015 (before **last year's** general election). This system was put into place to prevent voters from switching their party registrations shortly before a contested primary.  

If you're not sure whether you are eligible, call the NYC Board of Elections' hotline, 866-VOTE-NYC (866-868-3692), or 212-487-5496 for the hearing impaired.

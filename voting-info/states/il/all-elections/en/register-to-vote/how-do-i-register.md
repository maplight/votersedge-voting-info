You can register to vote **on the web** at the [Illinois Online Voter Application](https://ova.elections.il.gov/) site if you have an Illinois driver's license or state ID.  

You can register to vote **by mail** by downloading a [mail-in voter application](http://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/VotingInformation/PDF/R-19.pdf) and mailing it to your [local election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx). Your mail-in voter application must be postmarked prior to the close of registration to be valid. If you do not provide the necessary identification with your application, the first time you vote must be in-person.  

You can also register **in person** at the following locations:  
- County Clerk's Office  
- Board of Election Commissioner's Office  
- City and Village Offices  
- Township Offices  
- Schools  
- Public Libraries

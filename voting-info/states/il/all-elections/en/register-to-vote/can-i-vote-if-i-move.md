**If you moved within 27 days of the election within the same precinct** you can vote a full ballot by signing an affidavit at the polling place.  

**If you moved within 30 days of the election outside of your precinct,** but you still live in the State, you may update your registration to your new address using grace period registration through Election Day. Alternatively, you may vote a full ballot in your old polling place after completing an affidavit.  

**If you moved more than 30 days before the election outside of your precinct but within the same county or municipality,** you may update your registration using grace period registration through Election Day. Alternatively you may vote for federal offices only after completing an address correction form.  

**If you moved more than 30 days before the election out of your county or municipality,** you can only vote by re-registering from your new address.  

If any change in your name or address has occurred, please remember to contact [your election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx) to update your registration. However, even if you forget to update your information, **note that grace period registration is now available through Election Day in Illinois.**

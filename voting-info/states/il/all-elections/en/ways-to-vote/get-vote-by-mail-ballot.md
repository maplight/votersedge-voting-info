**If you wish to receive a vote-by-mail ballot, you must first submit an application** to vote by mail to your [local election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx). You can obtain an application [online](http://elections.il.gov/VotingInformation/VotingByMailMove.aspx), by mail or in person from your local election authority.  

Once you receive your application, you must complete it and return it to the election authority. **Completed applications must include the following information:**  
- Your name  
- Your home address  
- The address where you want your vote-by-mail ballot to be mailed  
- Your party affiliation (for primary elections only)  
- Your signature  

**Your completed application must be submitted to the election authority** within the following timeframe, depending on whether you submit it in person or by mail:  
- **In person:** You may submit your application in person no more than 90 days prior to Election Day and no less than 1 day prior to Election Day.  
- **By mail inside the U.S.:** You may submit your application by mail no more than 90 days prior to Election Day and no less than 5 days prior to Election Day.  
- **By mail outside the U.S.:** If you submit your application by mail more than 30 days prior to Election Day, you will receive a full ballot. If you submit your application by mail less than 30 days prior to Election Day, you will only receive a Federal ballot.

If you requested a vote-by-mail ballot, you will not be permitted to vote at your polling place on Election Day.  

**However, there are exceptions which may apply:**  
- You may submit your vote-by-mail ballot to the election judges at your polling place for cancellation.  
- You may fill out and sign an affidavit stating that you never received your vote-by-mail ballot.  
- You may fill out and sign an affidavit stating that you completed and returned your vote-by-mail ballot but your election authority never received it.  

**If you admit to receiving a vote-by-mail ballot but did not return it to your election authority, you will be permitted to vote provisionally.** (See [What is a provisional ballot?](#item-what-is-provisional-ballot)) Your provisional ballot will be kept separately until the election authority can confirm that they did not receive your vote-by-mail ballot.

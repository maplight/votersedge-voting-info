Provisional voting allows you to vote on election day in a situation where your eligibility to vote has been challenged by the election judge. **You can cast a provisional ballot for any of the following reasons:**  
- Your name does not appear on the official list of eligible voters for your precinct  
- Your voting status has been challenged by a majority of the election judges at your precinct  
- You did not provide identification when registering by mail and still cannot provide identification at the polling place  
- You vote during a court-ordered extended voting period  
- Your name appears on the list of voters who voted early but you claim not to have voted during the early voting period  
- You admit to receiving a vote-by-mail ballot, but failed to return it to the election authority or bring it to the polling place on Election Day  
- You attempted to register to vote on Election Day, but failed to provide identification  

**To cast a provisional ballot, you will follow these steps:**  
1. Fill out an Application to Vote and sign a Provisional Voter Affidavit, which will be provided by the election judge.  
2. You will be issued a provisional ballot and Provisional Ballot Envelope.  
3. Once you have voted your ballot, seal it in the Provisional Ballot Envelope and return it to the election judge.  
4. The election judge will deposit your provisional ballot in a separate container from the ballot box containing regular ballots.  
5. The election judge will provide you with written instructions on how to submit additional proof of registration to the election authority and how to determine after the election if your provisional ballot was counted.

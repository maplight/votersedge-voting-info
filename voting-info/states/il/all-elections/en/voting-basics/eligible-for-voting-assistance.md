**If you are disabled, visually impaired, or cannot read or write the English language,** you are entitled to receive assistance in the casting of your vote in the voting booth on Election Day.  

You may receive assistance from a person of your choice; however, the person providing assistance must vote as you direct and cannot be an officer or agent of your employer or union. If you do not specify a person to assist you in voting, you can request assistance from two election judges, one from each political party.  

**You may only receive voting assistance if you request it and only after you complete and sign an affidavit that will be provided by the election judge.**

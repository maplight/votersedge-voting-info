**What is a political party?**  
A political party is a group of people who try to determine public policy and influence government by getting their candidates elected to office.  

**What are the officially recognized political parties in Illinois?**  
Only the [Democratic Party](http://www.ildems.com/) and the [Republican Party](http://www.weareillinois.org/) are statewide, established political parties in the State of Illinois. However, a candidate may choose to have a label of another party appear alongside their name on the ballot. These labels are called **political party designations.**  

The [Green Party](http://www.ilgp.org/), while not officially recognized by the state, holds partisan primary elections in U.S. Congressional Districts 5 and 12.

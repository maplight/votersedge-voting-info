As a registered voter in Illinois, you may cast your ballot in person **no more than 40 days prior to Election Day,** without providing any reason, by appearing at the office of your [local election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx) during business hours or at a designated [Early Voting Center](http://www.elections.il.gov/VotingInformation/EarlyVotingLocations.aspx).  

**If you were already issued a vote-by-mail ballot,** you may still vote early if you submit your vote-by-mail ballot for cancellation to the election official conducting early voting at the election authority office or Early Voting Center. If you are unable to submit your vote-by-mail ballot, you may sign an affidavit before the election official affirming that you never received your vote-by-mail ballot or that you were informed by the election authority that they did not receive your ballot.

If you are a registered voter and you are admitted to a healthcare facility **no more than 14 days** before Election Day and are unable to travel to your polling place, you are entitled to personal delivery of your ballot. If you are admitted to a healthcare facility more than 14 days before the election, you may apply for a vote-by-mail ballot.  

**In order to vote via personal delivery, follow these steps:**  
- Obtain an Application for Ballot for Qualified Voter Admitted to Hospital, Nursing Home or Rehabilitation Center from your [local election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx).  
- Complete the application and have your physician complete and sign the Certificate of Attending Physician section.  
- After the application is completed, any registered voter from your precinct or any legal relative may hand-deliver the application to the office of the election authority.  
- This registered voter or legal relative will receive a ballot and can personally deliver it to you at the healthcare facility or your home where you are recovering.  
- Once you receive your ballot, vote in secret and complete the certification on the ballot return envelope.  
- Securely seal the envelope and give it back to the registered voter or legal relative. They must deliver the ballot to the election authority by 7 PM on Election Day for it to be counted.

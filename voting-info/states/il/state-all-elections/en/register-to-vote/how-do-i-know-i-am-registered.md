Within three weeks after you submit your voter registration application, **you will receive a voter ID card in the mail.** Once you receive this card, you are officially registered. If you do not receive the voter ID card within three weeks of registering, contact [your election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx).  

**You can verify your registration online** at the Illinois Election Authorityâ€™s [Registration and Polling Place Information](http://www.elections.il.gov/VotingInformation/RegistrationLookup.aspx) site by providing your first name, last name, and zip code.

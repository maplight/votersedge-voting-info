If it is **six or fewer days before Election Day,** you may be able to get an emergency vote-by-mail ballot.  

### Situations where emergency ballots are available  
You can make a written request for this ballot if you:  
- Are hospitalized, in a nursing home, sanatorium, or in your residence and you are too sick to get to the polling place.
- Have a physical handicap that causes you to be unable to get to your polling place.
- Have a physical handicap that makes you unable to vote at your polling place due to architectural barriers denying you physical access to the polling place, voting booth, or voting apparatus or machinery.
- Are unable to go to your polling place because of conditions resulting in your absence from the precinct on Election Day.

**How do I make the emergency request?**
Make a written request. Your [county elections office](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/new-voters/county-elections-offices/) might have a pre-printed form for you to use.  
- If you don’t have a form, then make sure that the request authorizes a particular person to bring you the ballot and is signed under the penalty of perjury.  
	You can use [Los Angeles County Emergency Vote-by-Mail Application](https://www.lavote.net/documents/emergency-vote-by-mail-application.pdf) sample request as a guide to help you write a request to your county.
- Mark the ballot as directed. For detailed instructions check [How do I vote by mail?](#item-vote-by-mail)
- Return the ballot and envelope personally, or through your authorized representative, to either the county elections office or any polling place in your county.  

Or, if you are able, you can go to your [county elections office](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/new-voters/county-elections-offices/) during open hours and [vote early in person.](#item-vote-early-in-person)

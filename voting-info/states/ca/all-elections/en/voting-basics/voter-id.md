To **register to vote,** you will need to provide your California driver’s license or ID card number or the last four digits of your Social Security number.  

Most of the time, **on Election Day** you are not required to show identification at the polling place unless:
- You are voting for the first time in a Federal election and you registered by mail. 
- You did not provide either your driver license number, state ID number, or the last four digits of your social security number on the registration card when registering by mail.
- Acceptable forms of ID include a California driver’s license, California identification card, passport, or a student ID card showing your name and photograph. Visit the [California Secretary of State](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voting-california/what-bring/) for more information on acceptable identification.

**I damaged, lost or marked my ballot incorrectly, what do I do to fix this?**
- You can get a new ballot **as long as you have not already cast your ballot.**
- **If you vote at a polling place** ask a poll worker for a new ballot.
- **If you have your vote-by-mail ballot,** you can turn it in and request a new ballot either at your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) or polling place.  

**If you do not have your original vote-by-mail ballot** you can vote using a provisional ballot.

- Each race has a blank spot with a line drawn on it for a write-in candidate.
- Mark the spot beside the line as if you were voting for a candidate whose name is printed on the ballot.
- Write the name of the candidate you wish to vote for on the line.
- Each county publishes a list of qualified write-in candidates.  
	The list will be available at your polling place and the [county elections office](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/new-voters/county-elections-offices/).  
- If you write in the name of a qualified write-in candidate, your vote will be counted.
- A vote for someone who is not on the qualified candidate list will not be counted.

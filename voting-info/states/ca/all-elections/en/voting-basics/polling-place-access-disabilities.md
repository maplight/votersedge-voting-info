### Accessible voting places  

Before each election, every registered voter is notified as to whether their polling place is accessible. This notification appears on the sample ballot mailed to each voter by their county.  

### Accessible voting machines  

Each polling place must have one voting machine that allows voters, including those who are blind or visually impaired, to cast a ballot without assistance. 

The voting machine permits voters to privately and independently verify vote choices and, if there is an error, allows them to correct those choices before submitting their final ballot. 

### Curbside voting  

Poll workers must also provide curbside voting for voters with disabilities who need this assistance.

A poll worker will bring the list to sign and the ballot to the voterâ€™s car.  The poll worker will take them back into the polling place and put the ballot in the ballot box or scanner.

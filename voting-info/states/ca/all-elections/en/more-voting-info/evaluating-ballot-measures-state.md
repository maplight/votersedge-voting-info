**How to evaluate ballot measures:**  
- Examine what the measure seeks to accomplish. Do you agree with these goals?  
- Who are the real sponsors and opponents of the measure?  
	Check **Voterâ€™s Edge California** to follow the money for state measures.  
- Is the measure written well? Will it create conflicts in law that may require court resolution?  
- Does the measure create its own revenue source? Does it earmark, restrict or obligate government revenues?  
- Does the measure mandate a government program against the cost of reducing overall flexibility in the budget?  
- Does the measure deal with one issue that can be easily decided by a YES or NO vote? Or, is it a complex issue that should be thoroughly examined in the legislative arena?  
- If the measure amends the Constitution, consider whether it really belongs in the Constitution.  
- Be wary of distortion tactics and commercials that rely on image but tell nothing of substance about the measure. Be aware of half truths.

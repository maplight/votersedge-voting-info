**What are bonds?**  
Bonds are a form of long-term borrowing that the state uses to raise money for large projects. The state sells bonds to investors and agrees to repay the investors, with interest, over a certain number of years, somewhat like a mortgage.  

**Why are bonds used?**  
Projects such as roads, school building, prisons, parks, office buildings, and housing for veterans involve large dollar costs, and are used over many years.  The use of bonds helps to fund the initial large dollar costs, which are hard to fund out of day-to-day operating revenues.  Also the repayment of these bonds over time means that future taxpayers who benefit from the facilities will help to pay for them.  

**What types of bonds does the state sell?**  
1. General Obligation Bonds  
	These are the most common type of bonds, and are largely repaid from the state’s unrestricted general tax revenues. These bonds have to be approved by the voters, and their repayment is guaranteed by the state.  
2. Revenue Bonds  
	These are repaid from a designated source—such as bridge tolls. Revenue bonds do not require voter approval and repayment is not guaranteed by the state.  
3. Lease-Revenue Bonds  
	There are repaid from lease payments by state agencies using the leased facilities. Lease-Revenue bonds do not require voter approval and repayment is not guaranteed by the state.  

**What are the direct costs of bond financing?**  
The state must repay the principal of the bonds over time to the investors until the bonds are fully paid off, plus annual interest costs. The interest cost of repaying bonds depends on the current interest rate and the time period over which the bonds are to be repaid.

**Day, Month Date, Year** is the voter registration application deadline for this election.  

It is important that your voter registration application be filled out completely and:  
- Submitted online no later than midnight 15 days before the election
- **OR** postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election.

If you **miss the deadline** your application will still be processed.  If approved, you will be able to vote in future elections.  

[Check the status of your voter registration](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/registration-status/) to make sure youâ€™re registered.

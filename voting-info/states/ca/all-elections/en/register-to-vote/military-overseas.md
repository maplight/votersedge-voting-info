Register to vote either using Californiaâ€™s [online voter registration](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) or by filling out the [Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)](https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca2013.pdf) if you are a U.S. citizen who is:  
- a member of the Uniformed Services (on active duty) or an eligible dependent
- a member of the Merchant Marine or an eligible dependent
- a commissioned corps of the Public Health Service
- a commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
- residing outside the United States  

For more information on using or obtaining an FPCA, visit the [California Secretary of State](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/military-overseas-voters/) or [this federal site](https://www.fvap.gov/).  

Be sure to fill out and submit the online voter registration or FPCA as early as **60 to 90 days before an election.**  

This will allow  time for voter information and ballots to be sent to you and for you to return your ballot. The **absolute deadline** for your registration form to be submitted online, postmarked, or delivered in person to the county elections office is **15 days before an election.**  

When you register to vote you will have the option to choose to have your ballot sent to you by mail, fax, or email.  

You will receive a permanent vote by mail status, but each time you move you must fill out either a new [online California voter registration form](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) or [FPCA](https://www.fvap.gov/).

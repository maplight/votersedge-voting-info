**You have a choice.**  
- You may choose among [qualified political parties](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/political-parties/qualified-political-parties/) or choose “other,”  
- **OR** If you do not want to identify as a member of a political party you can mark the box next to “No, I do not want to disclose a political party preference” on the voter registration form.  

Your choice to register with no party preference may affect your ability to vote in a **June primary election** for U.S. President and County Central Committees (party nominated offices) but not for other offices on the ballot.  

You may register with no party preference and still vote for any candidate on the ballot in the **November general election.**  

Check [Top Two Primary](#item-what-is-top-two-primary) for more information.

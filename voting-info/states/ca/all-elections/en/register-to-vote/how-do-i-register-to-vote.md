**On the web at [registertovote.ca.gov](https://www.registertovote.ca.gov)**
- If you have a California driver license or identification card number, you can authorize use of that signature for the registration form.  Fill out the online application and simply hit “submit” at the end.
- If there is no signature on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles, you will need to:
	1. Enter your date of birth and last four digits of your social security number.
	2. Click “print.”
	3. Sign the paper application.
    4. Mail it to the address provided.
    5. No printer? Go ahead and click “I don’t have the ability to print” and your county elections official will mail you a form to sign and return.

**By calling 800.345.VOTE (800.345.8683)** and asking to have a voter registration form sent to your home.  

**By picking up an official registration postcard** from your [county elections 	office](#section-election-office-contact), any DMV office, or a public library, post office, public assistance 	office, or any government office that serves the disabled.

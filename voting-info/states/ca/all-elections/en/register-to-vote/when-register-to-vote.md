##When should I register to vote?  

**Fill out a voter registration form by Monday, May 23, 2016 for the June 2016 Primary Election.**

It is important that your voter registration application be filled out completely and:
- Submitted online no later than midnight 15 days before the election; or
- Postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election.

If you **miss the deadline** your application will still be processed.  If approved, you will be able to vote in future elections.

Facsimile ballots will be available in Spanish.  

Some Vote Centers, including those located in Truckee, will have Spanish language assistance.  

The Nevada County Elections Office will provide a toll-free voter assistance hotline for Spanish speakers in Nevada County. This hotline will be operational 29 days before the election through 5 PM the day after the election. The number for this hotline will be posted on the Nevada County Elections website and in voting materials sent to voters.

Please call the Santa Cruz County Clerk's office at 831-454-2060 or TDD 711 or email access@votescount.com with questions or suggestions about accessible voting in Santa Cruz County.

Visit the [Voters with Disabilities](https://www.votescount.com/Home/VoterswithDisabilities.aspx) section of the website for more information.

#### Accessible Voting Places    

Check the back cover of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible. If your site is accessible, next to the symbol you will find the word Yes.

Curbside voting is available. Alternatively, the Elections Department can arrange to have an accessible van pick you up and take you to the polls to vote OR the Elections Department can deliver a ballot to your home and return it to the Elections Department. Please call before Election Day so there will be enough time to provide assistance.

#### Accessible Voting Information     

The poll worker will ask you if you want to vote using a paper ballot or an electronic touch screen ballot. Each polling place in the county has a touch screen voting unit that is ADA-compliant and has the following features:
    an audio option that reads the ballot to you
    a universal plug for a personal assistive device
    large font (24 points)
    a choice of English or Spanish

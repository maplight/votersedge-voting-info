#### Accessible Voting Places  
**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  
- "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible.  
- "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

#### Accessible Voting Information   
**Assistance to the Visually, Hearing, or Speech Impaired**  

The Registrar of Voters Office has a TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) to provide election information: 442-265-1066.  

For the visually impaired, assistance for local ballot measures is available from the Imperial County Elections Department.

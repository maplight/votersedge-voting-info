Request a one-time vote by mail ballot.  

- Download the [Vote-by-Mail Application](https://www.mendocinocounty.org/home/showdocument?id=21895), print it out, fill it in, and mail it to the address noted on the form.   

- Email, fax, or mail the [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact) a letter requesting a vote-by-mail ballot and include the data of the relevant election, your name, home address, the address to which you want the ballot mailed, and your signature.  

- Use the application on the back cover of the Sample Ballot mailed to registered voters in every election. Follow the directions given.  

Or become a permanent vote-by-mail voter by checking the "Permanent VBM Voter" box and returning the [Vote-by-Mail Application](https://www.mendocinocounty.org/home/showdocument?id=15143).

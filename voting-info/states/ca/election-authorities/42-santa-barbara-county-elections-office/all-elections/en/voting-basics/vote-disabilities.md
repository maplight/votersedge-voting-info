#### Accessible Voting Places  

To determine whether a polling place is accessible, voters can turn to the back cover of their County Voter Information Guide.

If the polling place is not accessible, voters may call (800) SBC-VOTE to find the nearest accessible location or to request Curbside Voting at their polling place. To request Curbside Voting at a polling place or one of the Elections Office locations, please call (800) SBC-VOTE or (800) 722-8683.

#### Accessible Voting Information  

Ballot information is available in large font formats and via audio recordings. Please contact the Registrar of Voters office locations to request these formats.

Accessible AutoMARK ballot-marking systems are available at all polling places as well as the three Registrar of Voters office locations. The AutoMARK provides an opportunity for voters who are blind, visually impaired, or have a disability or other conditions to traditionally mark a ballot without assistance. The AutoMARK has a Braille keypad, increased font size, and audio options as well as a touch screen.

Easy Grip Pens, Handi Lens Magnifiers, and Accessible Vote Booth are available upon request at all polling places in Santa Barbara County.

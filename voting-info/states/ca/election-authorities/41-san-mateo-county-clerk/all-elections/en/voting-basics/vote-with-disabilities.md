#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Information    

Vote Centers will be equipped with three accessible voting devices. The ballot marking tablet accommodates voters with visual impairments by presenting the ballot in audio format during an accessible voting session. 

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

- Request free transportation to and from a Vote Center during the early voting period. 
- Request audio ballot information and accessible PDF files by email. 
- Request to have a Vote by Mail paper ballot personally deivered to their home, and have an Elections Division staff to assist in marking and returning the ballot.

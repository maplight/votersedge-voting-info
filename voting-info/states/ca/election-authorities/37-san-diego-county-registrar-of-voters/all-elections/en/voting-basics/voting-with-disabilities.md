#### Accessible Voting Places   

**Check on the back cover** of your Sample Ballot and Voter Information Pamphlet for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible. The Pamphlet contains other important information about accessible voting and polling places.  

- "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible.  
- "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

#### Accessible Voting Information

The Registrar of Voters Office has a TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf). Call (800) 735-2929 for the TDD line.

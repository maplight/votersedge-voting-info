#### Accessible Voting Places   

San Diego County provides voting locations accessible for all people, regardless of ability. See if your poll is wheelchair accessible by looking at the back of your Sample Ballot Pamphlet: there will be a YES or NO printed below the blue accessibility symbol. If it says NO, you may call (858) 565-5800 to learn about voting methods that will work best for you. You may also request to have a ballot brought to an accessible location near your poll.

At any polling location that is determined inaccessible or that you are unable to enter, you may vote curbside:
- Poll workers can bring a ballot to you
- You may sit in your car and vote, or you may vote at the door of the building
- Call (858) 565-5800 before heading to your poll to make these arrangements

All polling locations have signature guide cards and magnifying sheets.

Every poll location will have a touchscreen voting machine that is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The touchscreen is equipped with a headset and telephone-style keypad for audio-based voting, as well as large print, zoom features, and height and tilt adjustments.

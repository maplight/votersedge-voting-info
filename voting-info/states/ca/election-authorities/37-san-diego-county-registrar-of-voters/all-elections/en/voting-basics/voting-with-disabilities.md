#### Accessible Voting Places   

San Diego County provides voting locations accessible for all people, regardless of ability. See if your poll is wheelchair accessible by looking at the back of your Sample Ballot Pamphlet: there will be a YES or NO printed below the blue accessibility symbol. If it says NO, you may call (858) 565-5800 to learn about voting methods that will work best for you. You may also request to have a ballot brought to an accessible location near your poll.

At any polling location that is determined inaccessible or that you are unable to enter, you may vote curbside:
- Poll workers can bring a ballot to you
- You may sit in your car and vote, or you may vote at the door of the building
- Call (858) 565-5800 before heading to your poll to make these arrangements

#### Accessible Voting Equipment 

All polling locations have an [accessible ballot marking device](https://www.sdvote.com/content/rov/en/outreach/bmd.html). Features include: 
- Touchscreen tablet, with options to change text size and contrast 
- Handheld controller with braille 
- Headphones and audio instructions in English, Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese
- Privacy mask, for voters with low vision to ensure their votes are kept private as they use the audio instructions
- The ability to use their own paddle, or sip and puff assistive device

Poll workers also have signature guide cards and magnifying sheets for voters with visual impairments. 

#### Remote Accessible Vote by Mail 

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

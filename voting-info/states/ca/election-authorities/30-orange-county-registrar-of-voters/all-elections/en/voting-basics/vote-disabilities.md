**Accessible Voting Places**  
**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or your polling place is accessible.  
- "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible.  
- “USABLE” means the voter’s polling place is temporarily accessible on Election Day.  
- "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

**Accessible Voting Equipment**  
Orange County’s  electronic voting system has audio headphones, raised Braille-labeled keys, and adaptive devices that provide large tactile buttons for motor issues as well as sip-n-puff capability. They also provide curbside voting if a voter cannot enter the polling place. In addition, a voter may vote-by-mail if that method is more convenient.

#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

Orange County's electronic voting system has audio headphones, raised Braille-labeled keys, and adaptive devices that provide large tactile buttons for motor issues as well as sip-n-puff capability. They also provide curbside voting if a voter cannot enter the polling place. In addition, a voter may vote-by-mail if that method is more convenient.

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off. You can request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot [here](https://www.ocvote.com/vlt/).

#### Accessible Voting Places    

If you vote at a polling site, to check polling site accessibility, look for the wheelchair symbol on the postcard insert that will be mailed to you about a month before the election.  

**Curbside Voting**  

If your polling site is not accessible, you may request curbside voting assistance: 
- Call 530-225-5730 in advance to coordinate a time and place. 
- Have an assistant make the request inside the polling place. 

#### Accessible Voting Information    

Each polling site in the county has a touch screen voting system with:  
- An audio option that reads the ballot to you  
- Large print  

If you need assistance getting to the polling site or with ballot delivery to your home, call the Registrar of Voters office.

**Accessible Voting Places**  
**Check the polling place location information on your Sample Ballot**, or use the [Sample Ballot Lookup](https://secure.sonoma-county.org/vote/polling_place_sample_ballot.aspx?sid=1070) on the Registrar of Voters’ website to determine whether your polling place is accessible.  

Most polling places are accessible. Curbside voting is available for those that are not. Please call the [Registrar of Voters](http://vote.sonoma-county.org/content.aspx?sid=1009&id=1046#contact_information) office at 707-565-6800 if you need to arrange for curbside voting on Election Day.  

Polling places are surveyed to identify which locations meet accessibility standards. Accessibility standards used in the surveys comply with Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR) as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG).  

**Accessible Voting Equipment**
Polling Places are equipped with supplies, including large-type instructions (posted), magnification sheets, and adapters for grasping ballot marking pens.  

Sonoma County offers the [eSlate® DAU](http://vote.sonoma-county.org/content.aspx?sid=1009&id=1046#contact_information) which has several accessible features, including audio playback of voter options and selections, “jelly” switches, and “sip and puff” compatibility.

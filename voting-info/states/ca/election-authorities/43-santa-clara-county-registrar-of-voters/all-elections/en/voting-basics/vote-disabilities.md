#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs. 

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

Santa Clara County's electronic voting system gives visually impaired voters the ability to cast a secret ballot without assistance. The voting system is equipped with an audio voting component that allows voters to listen to the ballot and make their choices using the keypad provided. The keypad includes a "sip and puff" feature as well. 

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

**Accessible Voting Places**  

If you vote at a polling site, to check polling site accessibility, look for the wheelchair symbol on the postcard insert that will be mailed to you about a month before the election.  

In some polling sites, temporary thresholds, ramps, signage, cones, and door props, are used to improve access to the facility.  

**Curbside Voting**  

If your polling site is not accessible, you may vote on a paper or an electronic ballot from a nearby accessible location, including a car. A poll worker will qualify you to vote and return the voted ballot to the polling place.  

To request curbside voting assistance, you can:  
- Call 530-225-5730 in advance to coordinate a time and place.  
- Have an assistant make the request inside the polling place.  

**Accessible Voting Information**  

Each polling site in the county has a touch screen voting system with:  
- An audio option that reads the ballot to you  
- Large print

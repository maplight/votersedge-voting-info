#### Accessible Voting Places    

Presently 100% of Placer County polling places are accessible. You may vote your ballot outside your polling place OR at the Placer County Elections Office office located at 2956 Richardson Drive in Auburn.

Any voter who cannot reach the voting area at the polling place because of architectural barriers or physical limitations may request to vote “curbside” (outside of the polling location). A poll worker will qualify the voter, bring a ballot, special marking pen, and secrecy sleeve to the voter, assist the voter as necessary, and then place the voter’s ballot in the ballot box.

**Call** 530-886-5672 with questions on polling place accessibility.

If a voter is homebound, in the hospital, in a residential care facility, or otherwise unable to go to the polls, the Elections Office can deliver and/or pick up a ballot for the voter. Normally this service is available two (2) weeks prior to an election. Call 530-886-5650 or toll-free in California at 1-800-824-8683 for assistance.

#### Accessible Voting Places  

To determine whether a polling place is accessible, voters can **turn to the back cover of their sample ballot**. A wheelchair symbol means the polling place is accessible.  

If the polling place is not accessible, voters may call 1-800-SBC-VOTE to find the nearest accessible location or to request Curbside Voting at a polling place. If Curbside Voting is requested at a polling place, someone will alert the precinct officers, and they will bring the voting materials to the voter.  

#### Accessible Voting Information  

Ballot information is available for the visually impaired on tape (State Information) and CD (Local Information). Tapes and CDs are available at Santa Barbara County Elections Office locations and may be requested by email or by calling 1-800-SBC-VOTE.   

For registration and election information, the Secretary of State has established a telecommunications device for voters who are hard of hearing. The TTY/TDD number is 800-833-8683.  

Easy Grip Pens and Handi Lens Magnifiers are also available upon request at all Vote Centers in Santa Barbara County.

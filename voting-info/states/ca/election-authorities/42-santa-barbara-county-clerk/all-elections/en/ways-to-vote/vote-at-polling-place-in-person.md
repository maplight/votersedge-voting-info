Find your polling place:  

- In the [My Polling Place](#section-my-polling-place) section of this site.  

- By calling (805) 568-2200  

- By looking on the **back cover of your Sample Ballot** for the address.  

Note: If you live in a **mail-only ballot precinct** because your area has a small number of registered voters, then you do not have an assigned polling place. If you are registered to vote in Santa Barbara, and you reside in a mail-only ballot precinct, then your ballot will be mailed to you.

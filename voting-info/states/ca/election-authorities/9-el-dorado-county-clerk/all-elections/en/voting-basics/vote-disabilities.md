#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.   

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All Vote Centers will have three accessible ballot marking devices. The devices come with accessibility features such as an Audio Tactile Interface (ATI) keypad with braille as well as audio instructions.

For any voter that cannot physically access a Vote Center, there is the option to vote “curbside”. Curbside voting allows you to vote from your car or at the door of the building. To schedule curbside voting call (530) 621-7480 or [email](mailto:elections@edcgov.us.) the El Dorado County Elections office.

For Voters with disabilities, El Dorado County uses a Remote Accessible Vote By Mail (RAVBM) system to allow voters with a disability to vote a vote by mail ballot using their computer and accessibility tools at their disposal. To apply for a RAVBM ballot, please fill out the [RAVBM Application](https://edcgov.us/Government/Elections/Documents/RAVBM%20Application.pdf) and fax/email/mail it to the [El Dorado County Elections office](#menu-item-contact-county-election-office).

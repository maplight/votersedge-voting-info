Accessible vote-by-mail is a ballot delivery option that allows voters with disabilities to access their ballot using any computer with internet access. Voters can use their assistive devices to read and mark the ballot outside of a polling place, and then print and return it to the Department of Elections. Visit [Accessible Vote-by-Mail](https://sfelections.sfgov.org/accessible-vote-mail-system) for more information.

#### Accessible Voting Places  

To confirm whether your polling place has an accessible entrance and voting area, check the back cover of your Voter Information Pamphlet for the international symbol of access, use the Polling Place and Sample Ballot Lookup Tool, or call (415) 554-4375. Teletypewriter (TTY) users may also call (415) 554-4386.

If your polling place is not accessible, you may choose to vote at a nearby accessible polling place. 

Any voter who cannot access a polling place or the City Hall Voting Center may request to vote “curbside.” A voter can either call (415) 554-4375 or have a passenger or a friend enter the polling place or the City Hall Voting Center and give the voter’s information to a poll worker or a staff member.

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All polling places and Voting Centers have
- accessible ballot-marking devices, which are compatible with a number of assistive devices 
- large-print instructions on how to mark a ballot
- optical sheets to magnify the print 
- pen attachments to make the writing utensils easier to grip

The Department can also dispatch a head-pointer or a multi-user sip/puff device to a polling place on Election Day upon request. If you would like to request such device to be available at your polling place, please contact the Department at (415) 554-4375 or TTY (415) 554-4386.

#### Accessible Voter Information Pamphlet  

The San Francisco Voter Information Pamphlet is available in additional accessible formats, including a large-print booklet, audiocassette, and thumb-drive (MP3 audio). To request the Pamphlet in one of these formats, call (415) 554-4375 or TTY (415) 554-4386.

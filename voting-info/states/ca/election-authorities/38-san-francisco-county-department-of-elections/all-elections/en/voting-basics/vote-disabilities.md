#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible. "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible. "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

Each polling place has one Edge accessible voting machine that provides a touch screen ballot, audio ballot with audio headphones, raised Braille-labeled keys, and adaptive devices that provide large tactile buttons for motor issues as well as sip-n-puff capability. Call 415-554-4384 to request this device, preferably 72 hours before the election to help ensure availability and assist in scheduling.  

Curbside voting is available if a voter cannot enter the polling place. In addition, a voter may vote-by-mail if that method is more convenient.  

Visit [San Francisco Accessible Voting and Services](http://sfgov.org/elections/accessible-voting-and-services) for more information.

#### Accessible Voting Places    

**Check on the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All Vote Centers have accessible ballot-marking devices.

The ballot-marking device allows voters to navigate through their ballots using features such as:

- Touchscreen tablet with options to change text and background colors and the text size
- Braille-embossed handheld keypad (audio-tactile interface)
- Headphones and audio instructions in English and Spanish  

Voters may bring in their own assistive devices, including sip-and-puff systems, paddles, and head-pointers. 

#### Accessible Voting Information
Contact the elections office by phone at (951) 486-7200, (800) 773-8683, or by [email](mailto:rovweb@rivco.org).

You can also vote with Remote Accessible Vote-by-Mail. RAVBM lets you:
- Download, mark, and print your ballot at home
- Use your own assistive technology to read and mark the ballot
- Select the language for your ballot

The Riverside County [website](https://sites.omniballot.us/06065/app/home) will meet accessibility requirements and use best practices for voters with disabilities to access the site.

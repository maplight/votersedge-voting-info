#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  

At any Calaveras County polling place that is exempt from the accessibility requirements or if you are unable to enter the polling place, you may vote curbside. Trained election officials will bring a ballot to you. You may sit in your car and vote, or you may vote at the door of the building.

#### Accessible Voting Information

#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment 

Every Vote Center will have at least one accessible voting machine. The machine includes features like audio ballots, large print/zoom features, and height and tilt adjustments on the screens.

For any voter that cannot physically access a Vote Center, there is the option to vote “curbside”. Curbside voting allows you to vote from your car or at the door of the building. To schedule curbside voting call (209) 754-6376.

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

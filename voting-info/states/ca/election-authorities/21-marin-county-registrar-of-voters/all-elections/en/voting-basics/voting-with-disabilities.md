#### Accessible Voting Places   

    Find the access symbol on the back cover of your County Voter Information Guide. Look for the word YES or NO near the symbol.
        YES means your polling place is fully accessible.
        NO means your polling place does not meet all current accessibility requirements. However, alternative facilitation may make it accessible to you.
        
    If your current polling place is not accessible, and you want to vote at an accessible polling place, call us at least 2 weeks before the election: (415) 473-6439.
 

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

Each polling place in Marin County has:  

- A wheelchair accessible voting booth,  

- Magnifiers,  

- Pens with grips that are easy to hold,  

- An AUTOMARK, an accessible ballot marking device to help you vote your ballot independently and privately.  

- A Sip and Puff device for use with the AUTOMARK is available on Election Day by calling (415) 473-6456.  

- Curbside voting for voters who cannot get into the polling place. A poll worker can bring a ballot to you. After you vote, the poll worker will put your voted ballot in the ballot box.  

All state propositions are available on audio tape. If you want one, call (415) 473-6456.

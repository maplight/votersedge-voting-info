#### Accessible Voting Places   

**Call (415) 473-6456** or **check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

Each polling place in Marin County has:  

- A wheelchair accessible voting booth,  

- Magnifiers,  

- Pens with grips that are easy to hold,  

- An AUTOMARK, an accessible ballot marking device to help you vote your ballot independently and privately.  

- A Sip and Puff device for use with the AUTOMARK is available on Election Day by calling (415) 473-6447.  

- Curbside voting for voters who cannot get into the polling place. A poll worker can bring a ballot to you. After you vote, the poll worker will put your voted ballot in the ballot box.

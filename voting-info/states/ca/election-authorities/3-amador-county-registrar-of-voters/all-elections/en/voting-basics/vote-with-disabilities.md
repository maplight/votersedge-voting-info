#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

All Vote Centers will have at least two voting booths for a chair or wheelchair, magnifying glasses, and pen grips. There will be three accessible ballot marking devices that can accommodate a chair or wheelchair, to help voters with specific needs vote independently and privately.  

For any voter that cannot physically access a Vote Center, there is the option to vote “curbside”. Curbside voting allows you to vote from your car or at the door of the building. To schedule curbside voting call (209) 223-6465.

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

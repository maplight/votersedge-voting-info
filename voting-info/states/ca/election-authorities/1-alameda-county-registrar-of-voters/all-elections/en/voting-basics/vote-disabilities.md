#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check [online](https://www.acgov.org/rovapps/maps/avl/) or on the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible. "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible. "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment

Designated accessible voting booths are available at every polling place in Alameda County, where a voter who uses a wheelchair can easily access the booth and vote.

Voters have the option to use an accessible touchscreen voting machine which also provides an audio ballot feature. The audio feature is available in English, Chinese, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. 

For any voter that cannot physically access a Vote Center, there is the option to vote "curbside." You may sit in a car and vote or vote near the polling place. For more information, please call (510) 272-6933.

To request a Voter Information Pamphlet in an audio MP3 format (on the website) or on CD format (mailed by request), please call (510) 272-6933. 

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot (RAVBM). You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, and then print and return it to the Alameda County Registrar of Voters’ Office. Official ballots will be available through the RAVBM portal beginning 29 days before every election. They can be accessed through the Alameda County Election Site, [click here.](https://www.acgov.org/rovmvp_app/mvp.do) To learn more about using an accessible vote-by-mail ballot, [click here.](https://www.acvote.org/accessibility)

#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check [online](http://www.acgov.org/rov_app/pollinglist/) or on the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible. "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible. "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

Voters have the option to use an accessible touchscreen voting machine which provides an audio ballot feature. The audio feature is available in English, Chinese, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. 

A voter who is unable to enter his or her polling place because it is inaccessible may request to be assigned to an accessible polling place by calling (510) 272-6933. Requests must be made no later than two weeks before an election.

For any voter that cannot physically access a Vote Center, there is the option to vote "curbside." You may sit in a car and vote or vote near the polling place. For more information, please call (510) 272-6933.

#### Accessible Voting Information   

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

To request a Voter Information Pamphlet in an audio MP3 format (on the website) or on CD format (mailed by request), please call (510) 272-6933.

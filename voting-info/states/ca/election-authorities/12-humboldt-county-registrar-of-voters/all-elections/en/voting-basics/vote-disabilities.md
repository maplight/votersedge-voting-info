#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for an asterick * or wheelchair symbol next to your assigned polling place that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible. Accessible voting is also available at the Election Office.

Each polling place has an accessible voting machine that offers ballot marking, adjustable audio, touch screen and limited dexterity buttons, and adjustable font size and contrast. 

All polling places will have curbside voting available; to arrange for curbside voting, please contact the Elections Office at 707-445-7481 or humboldt_elections@co.humboldt.ca.us.

#### Accessible Voting Information   

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

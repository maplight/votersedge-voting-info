#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All Vote Centers have accessible ballot-marking devices.

The ballot-marking device allows voters to navigate through their ballots using features such as:

- Touchscreen tablet with options to change text and background colors and the text size
- Braille-embossed handheld keypad (audio-tactile interface)
- Headphones and audio instructions in English and Spanish  

Voters may bring in their own assistive devices, including sip-and-puff systems, paddles, and head-pointers. 

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.   

Voters can also request audio ballot information and accessible PDF files by email. Voters using the ballot-marking device have the option to view or hear a summary of their choices and change any selections before printing their ballots.

#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers are required to be accessible to people with disabilities.

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All Vote Centers have accessible ballot-marking devices.

The ballot-marking device allows voters to navigate through their ballots using features such as:

- Touchscreen tablet with options to change text and background colors and the text size
- Braille-embossed handheld keypad (audio-tactile interface)
- Headphones and audio instructions in English and Spanish  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.   

Voters can also request audio ballot information and accessible PDF files by email.  

#### Accessible Voting Information  

Contact the Elections Division at 707-253-4321 or [email](mailto:elections@countyofnapa.org) with questions. The Elections Division TTY phone line is 707-299-1475.   

The Napa County [website](https://www.countyofnapa.org/396/Elections) will meet accessibility requirements and use best practices for voters with disabilities to access the site.

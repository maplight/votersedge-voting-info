#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, Help America Vote Act compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

San Benito County’s electronic voting system with accessible features, including touchscreen and audio, gives voters with disabilities the ability to cast a secret ballot without assistance. The voting system is equipped with an audio voting component that allows voters to listen to the ballot and make their choices using the keypad provided.The keypad includes a “sip and puff” feature as well.

For any voter that cannot physically access a Vote Center, there is the option to vote “curbside”. Curbside voting allows you to vote from your car or at the door of the building. To utilize curbside voting you can call (877)777-4017.

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot (RAVBM). Voters can request a RAVBM ballot on [My Voter Status](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/), by calling (877) 777-4017, or emailing sbcvotes@cosb.us. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

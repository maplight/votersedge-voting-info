#### Accessible Voting Places  

Check the back cover of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

As an alternative to paper ballots, each polling place will have a touch screen voting unit available upon request. Votes are cast by touching a screen or with an audio headset and keypad attachment. Ballot text can also be enlarged for easier reading.  

Curbside voting is available at the polls if a voter cannot enter the polling place. In addition, a voter may vote-by-mail if that method is more convenient.  

Call (559) 624-7300 for more information about accessibility.

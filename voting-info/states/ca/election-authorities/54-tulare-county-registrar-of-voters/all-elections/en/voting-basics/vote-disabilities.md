**Accessible Voting Places**  
All polling places in Tulare County have been determined to be accessible to people with disabilities.  

**Accessible Voting Equipment**  

As an alternative to paper ballots, each polling place will have a touch screen voting unit available upon request. Votes are cast by touching a screen or with an audio headset and key pad attachment. Ballot text can also be enlarged for easier reading.  

Curbside voting is available at the polls if a voter cannot enter the polling place. In addition, a voter may vote-by-mail if that method is more convenient.  

Call (559) 624-7300 for more information about accessibility.

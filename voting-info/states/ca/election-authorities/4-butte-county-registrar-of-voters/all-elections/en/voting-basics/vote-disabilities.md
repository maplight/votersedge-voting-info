#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections workers will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

All Vote Centers will have voting booths for a chair or wheelchair, magnifying glasses, and pen grips. There will be three accessible ballot marking devices that can accommodate a chair or wheelchair, to help voters with specific needs vote independently and privately.  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections workers will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

All Vote Centers will have voting booths for a chair or wheelchair, magnifying glasses, and pen grips. There will be three accessible ballot marking devices that can accommodate a chair or wheelchair, to help voters with specific needs vote independently and privately.  

If you are unable to go inside a Voter Assistance Center, you may vote a paper ballot from your car. To request curbside voting assistance, you can have an assistant make the request inside any Voter Assistance Center or call in advance at (530) 552‐3400 Option 1 or (800) 894‐7761 within Butte County.

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

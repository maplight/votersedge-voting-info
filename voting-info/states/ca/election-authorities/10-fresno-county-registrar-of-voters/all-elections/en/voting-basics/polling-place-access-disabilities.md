#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment

Voters with disabilities can request and receive access to the Remote Accessible Vote by Mail (RAVBM) system. The Remote Accessible Vote by Mail system allows voters with disabilities to download and mark their correct ballot privately and independently using their own assistive technology, print their marked ballot, and mail it to the Elections Office to be counted. The County of Fresno has selected Democracy Live Secure Select to provide this service. You can learn more about RAVBM on the Fresno County Elections [website](https://www.co.fresno.ca.us/departments/county-clerk-registrar-of-voters/remote-accessible-vote-by-mail).

#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  

Wheelchair accessible voting booths are available at all Merced County polling places.  

#### Accessible Voting Information  

Voteing Assistance Centers will provide accessible ballot marking devices for voters with disabilities. Those who go to a Voting Assistance Center will be asked to wear a mask and may have to wait in line.

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot in English or Espa√±ol/Spanish. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off. To learn more about using an accessible vote-by-mail ballot, [click here.](https://www.co.merced.ca.us/3448/RAVBM-Remote-Accessible-Vote-by-Mail) [Email Elections](mailto:elections@countyofmerced.com) or call (209) 385-7541 for help with the Remote Accessible Vote by Mail system. 

Merced County's Multilingual Virtual Poll Worker Program (MVP) assists voters who are deaf by providing iPads which connect voters to American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters. The Elections Department will have an MVP at each Voting Assistance Center.

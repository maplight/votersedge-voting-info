In accordance with federal law and local ordinance, Merced County provides voter registration information, election materials and oral assistance in English and Spanish. Voters who request election materials in the Spanish language will be mailed a translated sample ballot for all Merced County-conducted elections.  

Additionally, poll locations that have been identified as requiring oral language assistance are supplied with translated voting materials and staffed with bilingual poll workers whenever possible. Signs are posted in those poll locations identifying that the Spanish language is spoken.  

Some precincts are required to post a facsimile ballot and related instructions in the ខ្មែរ/Khmer, Punjabi, and Syriac languages.  

To learn more about the language assistance the Merced County elections office provides, visit the [Registrar of Voters Language Assistance page](http://www.stanvote.com/language-assistance.shtm).

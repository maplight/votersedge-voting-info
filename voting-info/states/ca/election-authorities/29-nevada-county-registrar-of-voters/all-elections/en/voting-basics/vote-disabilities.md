#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers are required to be accessible to people with disabilities.

Voters may vote on a paper or an electronic ballot from a nearby accessible location, including a car. To request curbside voting assistance, you can ring the doorbell outside of a vote center or call the Nevada County elections office at (530) 265-1298. 

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All vote centers will be equipped with at least three accessible electronic voting machines (HART eSlates) and have paper ballots available if desired. These electronic voting machines will have the option of an audio ballot in English and Spanish. These machines can accomodate Tactile Switches and sip-and-puff technology. Magnifying tools are freely available on tables. If you need any other assistance with voting, vote center staff will be available upon request to read or help mark ballots. 

All exterior and interior ballot drop off locations will be accessible and as near to public transportation routes as possible. The 24-hour ballot drop off location at the Nevada County Government Building (Rood Center) is accessible and on a public transportation route.  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off. You can request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot [here](https://sites.omniballot.us/06057/app/ravbm/eligibility).

Voters can also request audio ballot information and accessible PDF files by email.

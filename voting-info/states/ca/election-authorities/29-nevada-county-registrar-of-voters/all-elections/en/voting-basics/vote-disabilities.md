#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers are required to be accessible to people with disabilities.

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All vote centers will be equipped with at least three accessible electronic voting machines (HART eSlates) and have paper ballots available if desired. These electronic voting machines will have the option of an audio ballot and a connection for sip-and-puff technology.  

All exterior and interior ballot drop off locations will be accessible and as near to public transportation routes as possible. The 24-hour ballot drop off location at the Nevada County Government Building (Rood Center) is accessible and on a public transportation route.  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.  

Voters can also request audio ballot information and accessible PDF files by email.

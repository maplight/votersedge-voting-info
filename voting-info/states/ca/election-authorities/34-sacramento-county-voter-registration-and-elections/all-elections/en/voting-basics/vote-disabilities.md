#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on-site to assist voters with specific needs.  

For any voter that cannot physically access a Vote Center, there is the option to vote "curbside." You may sit in a car and vote or vote at the door of the building. To schedule curbside voting call (916) 875-6100 or email [PrecinctOperations@saccounty.net​](mailto:PrecinctOperations@saccounty.net​).  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

All Sacramento County registered voters can use one of the three accessible ballot marking devices at any Vote Center. The ballot can be marked using the touch screen display, provided audio tactile device, or their own assistive technology. Vote Centers will also have at least two voting booths for a chair or wheelchair, magnifying glasses, and pen grips. The devices will have Headphones and Audio Instructions in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Taiwanese.  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off. You can request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot on the [Sacramento County Elections site](https://elections.saccounty.net/Pages/accessiblevbm.aspx). For more information about this option, please call (916) 875-6155, email [VBM@SacCounty.net​](mailto:VBM@SacCounty.net​), or visit the [Sacramento County Elections website](https://elections.saccounty.net/Pages/accessiblevbm.aspx).

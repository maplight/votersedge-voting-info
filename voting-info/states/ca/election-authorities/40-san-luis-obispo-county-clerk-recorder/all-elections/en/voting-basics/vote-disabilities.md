Check the back cover of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible. 

- "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible.  
- "USABLE" means the voter’s polling place is temporarily accessible on Election Day.  
- "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible. 

**OR**

Look up [your polling place](https://clerk.slocounty.ca.gov/pollingplace/) for audio enabled sample ballot and accessibility details.

**Accessible Voting Places**  

An accessible ballot marking device is available at every polling place and has features to assist voters in reading and marking a ballot independently.

At polling places, poll workers will assist a voter as requested and can facilitate curbside voting.

If you have questions or need assistance, email **[eo.recruitment@vote.cccounty.us](mailto:eo.recruitment@vote.cccounty.us)** or call (925) 335-7800.

**Accessible Voting Places**  

**Check on the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible. "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

Contact the Elections Division at 707-253-4322 or [email](mailto:elections@countyofnapa.org) with questions.

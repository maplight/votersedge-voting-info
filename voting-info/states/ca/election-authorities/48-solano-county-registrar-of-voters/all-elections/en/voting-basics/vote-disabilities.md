**Accessible Voting Places**  
**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  "YES" means the voter’s polling place is accessible. "NO" means the voter’s polling place is not accessible.  

**Accessible Voting Equipment**  
Solano County’s  electronic voting system has audio headphones, raised Braille-labeled keys, and adaptive devices that provide large tactile buttons for motor issues as well as sip-n-puff capability.  

Curbside voting is available if a voter cannot enter the polling place. In addition, a voter may vote-by-mail if that method is more convenient.  

For specific information and assistance, please call (707) 784-6675.

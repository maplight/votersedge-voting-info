#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.   

At your assigned poll place, all voters can request to vote "Curb-Side" from the comfort of your vehicle. Look for the blue cone outside of your polling place, and call the number listed on the cone. Pollworkers will come out to your car with your ballot and will securely deposit it for you.

For specific information, please call (707) 784-6675.

#### Accessible Voting Information  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

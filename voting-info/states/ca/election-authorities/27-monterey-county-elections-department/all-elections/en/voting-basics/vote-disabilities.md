#### Accessible Voting Places    

**Check the back cover** of your Sample Ballot for the wheelchair symbol that shows whether or not your polling place is accessible.  

#### Accessible Voting Information   

If you are a voter with a disability who requires assistance from a screen reader or other technology to read and/or to mark your ballot, you can access your ballot via a secure portal. Your ballot can be read by the technology of your choice and marked on your home marking device. You will still have to print the ballot and return the ballot by mail or in person. For more information please call the Elections office (831) 796-1499 or toll-free (866) 887-9274.

Monterey County provides touch screen and electronic voting at each polling place under the Federal Help America Vote Act (HAVA) for those with sight or mobility impairments or limited reading skills who need help with voting. It offers voting through audio and visual means, and allows the use of assistive devices (i.e., sip & puff, stylus). Any voter who wants to use assistive technology should ask a poll worker for help. Voting assistance is also on hand at the Elections Office during the 29 day early voting period before each election.

Poll workers will also provide curbside voting if a voter cannot enter the polling place. 

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off. For more information please call the Elections office (831) 796-1499,  toll-free (866) 887-9274, or TTY 831-755-5349.

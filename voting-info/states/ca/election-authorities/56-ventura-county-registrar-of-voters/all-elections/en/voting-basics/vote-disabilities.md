Please see [Information for Voters with Disabilities](https://recorder.countyofventura.org/elections/elections/voter-information/voters-with-disabilities/) for more details or contact the Elections Division at (805) 654-2664.

#### Accessible Voting Places    

Paper, touchscreen, and audio ballots are available in English and Spanish at all polling places on Election Day and the Government Center Voting Center, beginning 29 days before the election.

To confirm whether an In-Person Voting Location has an accessible entrance and voting area, check the inside of your Voter Information Pamphlet for the list of In-Person Voting Locations and if they have an international symbol of access, OR use the [County Voter Information Guide Lookup Tool](https://recorder.countyofventura.org/elections/elections/voter-lookups/my-sample-ballot/), OR call (805) 654-2664.

Curbside voting is available at polling places that are not accessible or you may choose to vote at a nearby accessible polling place. 

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

Each polling place is equipped with a touchscreen voting system that includes an audio mode. The accessible ICX voting machine allows voters to connect a personal assistive device such as a rocker paddle or multi-user sip/puff device when voting.

All polling places provide large-print instructions, optical magnifiers, and pen attachments.

#### Accessible Sample Ballot and Elections Information  

- An accessible [Sample Ballot](https://recorder.countyofventura.org/elections/voter-lookups/my-sample-ballot/#) is available online. 

#### Accessible Vote by Mail

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot (RAVBM). You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off. To sign up for RAVBM, please call (805) 654-2664 or email [VenturaVoterRegistration@ventura.org](mailto:VenturaVoterRegistration@ventura.org).

Curbside voting is available. Please call the Registrar of Voters office at 707-565-6800 if you need to arrange for curbside voting on Election Day.    

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

The elections office at 435 Fiscal Drive, Santa Rosa, will have an accessible ballot marking device for use starting 29 days before Election Day.

Sonoma County now uses Dominion’s ImageCast X (ICX) Ballot Marking Device. This device allows any voter to navigate through their entire ballot using features such as:
    Touchscreen Tablet, with options to change the text size and contrast on the tablet
    Audio Tactile Interface Keypad (ATI) with Braille
    Headphones and Audio Instructions
    Privacy Mask, for voters with low vision to ensure their votes are kept private as they use the Audio Instructions
    Ability for a voter to bring in their own Paddle or Sip And Puff assistive device

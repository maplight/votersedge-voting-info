Check [online](https://sonomacounty.ca.gov/CRA/Registrar-of-Voters/General-Voting-Info/Accessible-Voting/) for more information for Sonoma County voters with disabilities. 

#### Accessible Voting Places  

**Check the polling place location information on your Sample Ballot**, or use the [Sample Ballot Lookup](https://secure.sonoma-county.org/vote/polling_place_sample_ballot.aspx?sid=1070) on the Registrar of Voters’ website to determine whether your polling place is accessible.  

Curbside voting is available. Please call the Registrar of Voters office at 707-565-6800 if you need to arrange for curbside voting on Election Day.    

#### Accessible Voting Equipment  

The elections office at 435 Fiscal Drive, Santa Rosa, will have an accessible ballot marking device for use starting 29 days before Election Day. Voting precints will have accessible ballot marking devices so you can mark your ballot independently and privately. 

Sonoma County now uses Dominion’s ImageCast X (ICX) Ballot Marking Device. This device allows any voter to navigate through their entire ballot using features such as:
- Touchscreen Tablet, with options to change the text size and contrast on the tablet
- Audio Tactile Interface Keypad (ATI) with Braille
- Headphones and Audio Instructions
- Privacy Mask, for voters with low vision to ensure their votes are kept private as they use the Audio Instructions
- Ability for a voter to bring in their own Paddle or Sip And Puff assistive device 

#### Accessible Voting Information  

- TDD for hearing impaired persons: 707-565-6888.  

- Audio tapes of state propositions and local measures (including arguments and analyses) are available for the visually impaired. Call 707-565-6800.   

#### Accessible Vote by Mail 

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.

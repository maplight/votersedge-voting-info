#### Accessible Voting Places    

All Vote Centers will be ADA compliant, and Elections personnel will be on site to assist voters with specific needs.  

#### Accessible Voting Equipment    

Vote Centers will be equipped with three Disabled Access eSlate electronic voting machines.  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off. [Contact the Mariposa County Elections Office](https://www.mariposacounty.org/87/Elections) to learn more about getting an accessible ballot.

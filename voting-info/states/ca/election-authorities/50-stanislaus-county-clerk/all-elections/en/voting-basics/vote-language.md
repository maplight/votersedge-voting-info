Visit the [Espa√±ol/Spanish](http://stanvote.com/spanish/) version of the Registrar of Voters website.  

In accordance with federal law and local ordinance, Stanislaus County provides voter registration information, election materials and oral assistance in English and Spanish. Voters who request election materials in the Spanish language will be mailed a translated sample ballot for all Stanislaus County-conducted elections.  

Additionally, poll locations that have been identified as requiring oral language assistance are supplied with translated voting materials and staffed with bilingual poll workers whenever possible. Signs are posted in those poll locations identifying that the Spanish language is spoken.  

Some precincts are required to post a facsimile ballot and related instructions in the Hindi or Khmer languages.

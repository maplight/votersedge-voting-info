**Facsimile (non-official) ballots and bilingual staff assistance** are available upon request and at certain Vote Centers in the following languages:

Additionally, poll locations that have been identified as requiring oral language assistance are supplied with translated voting materials and staffed with bilingual poll workers whenever possible. Signs are posted in those poll locations identifying that the Spanish language is spoken. 

A vote by mail voter may call, mail, fax or email a request to receive a copy of a facsimile ballot in Khmer, Punjabi or Syriac (Assyrian) by mail. The request must be received by the elections official no later than 7 days before an election.

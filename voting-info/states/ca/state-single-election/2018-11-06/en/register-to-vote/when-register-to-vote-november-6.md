**Fill out a [voter registration form](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) no later than Monday, October 22, 2018.**  

It is important that your voter registration application be filled out completely and:  
- Submitted online before midnight on October 22; or  
- Postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office by October 22.  

Even if you missed the voter registration deadline, it isn't too late to vote. With [Same-Day Voter Registration](#menu-item-missed-the-voter-registration-deadline-you-can-still-register-and-vote), you can register up to and on Election Day.

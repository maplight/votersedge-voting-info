**Postage for your ballot**  
Check with your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) for the cost of postage.  Many ballots require extra stamps, so double check.  

**Mail your ballot early!**  
Detailed instructions are provided above in [Vote by Mail](#menu-item-vote-by-mail).  

We always recommend that you vote early to avoid the uncertainty of mailing at the last minute.  And donâ€™t forget! If you do wait until the last minute you can drop the ballot off at any polling location in your county instead of mailing it.

#### What rights do I have for language assistance?  
- Local elections officials are required to provide services and official election materials to bilingual voters in precincts where there are a certain number of people who speak the language.
- In some localities, voter information pamphlets and sample ballots are translated into Chinese, Spanish, Tagalog and Vietnamese, among other languages.
- In some polling places, bilingual poll workers are available to assist voters in their own language.  

**Know your rights**  
Get information about your rights from [Asian Americans Advancing Justice, California](
http://www.advancingjustice-alc.org/know-your-voting-rights/). The materials will help first-time voters, immigrant voters, and limited-English proficient voters exercise their right to vote on Election Day. They have instructions on how to register to vote, how to vote, how to access language assistance in the voting process, and how to handle problems encountered during Election Day, among other subjects. Currently, these materials are only available in English, but they will be translated into other languages before the November general election.

The voter registration application deadline is **no later than Monday, May 23.**  

It is important that your voter registration application be filled out completely and:  
- Submitted online no later than midnight 15 days before the election
- **OR** postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election.

If you **miss the deadline** your application will still be processed.  If approved, you will be able to vote in future elections.  

[Check the status of your voter registration](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/registration-status/) to make sure youâ€™re registered.  

For detailed information check [Register to Vote](#section-register-to-vote).

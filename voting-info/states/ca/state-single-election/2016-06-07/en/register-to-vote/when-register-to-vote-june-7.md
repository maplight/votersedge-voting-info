**Fill out a [voter registration form](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) no later than Monday, May 23.**  

It is important that your voter registration application be filled out completely and:  
- Submitted online before midnight 15 days before the election; or  
- Postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election.  

If you **miss the deadline** your application will still be processed.  If approved, you will be able to vote in future elections.

<p>The <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/voter-info/voter-bill-of-rights.htm">California Voter Bill of Rights</a> says:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have the right to cast a ballot if you are a valid registered voter.
<p>A valid registered voter means a United States citizen who is a resident in this state, who is at least 18 years of age and not in prison or on parole for conviction of a felony, and who is registered to vote at his or her current residence address.</p>
</li>
<li>You have the right to cast a provisional ballot if your name is not listed on the voting rolls.</li>
<li>You have the right to cast a ballot if you are present and in line at the polling place prior to the close of the polls.</li>
<li>You have the right to cast a secret ballot free from intimidation.</li>
<li>You have the right to receive a new ballot if, prior to casting your ballot, you believe you made a mistake.
<p>If at any time before you finally cast your ballot, you feel you have made a mistake, you have the right to exchange the spoiled ballot for a new ballot. Vote-by-mail voters may also request and receive a new ballot if they return their spoiled ballot to an elections official prior to the closing of the polls on election day.</p>
</li>
<li>You have the right to receive assistance in casting your ballot, if you are unable to vote without assistance.</li>
<li>You have the right to return a completed vote-by-mail ballot to any precinct in the county.</li>
<li>You have the right to election materials in another language, if there are sufficient residents in your precinct to warrant production.</li>
<li>You have the right to ask questions about election procedures and observe the election process.
<p>You have the right to ask questions of the precinct board and elections officials regarding election procedures and to receive an answer or be directed to the appropriate official for an answer. However, if persistent questioning disrupts the execution of their duties, the board or election officials may discontinue responding to questions.</p>
</li>
<li>You have the right to report any illegal or fraudulent activity to a local elections official or to the Secretary of State's Office.</li>

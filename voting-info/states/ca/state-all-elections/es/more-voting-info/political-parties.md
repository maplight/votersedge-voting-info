**What is a political party?**  

A political party is a group of people who try to determine public policy and influence government by getting its candidates elected to office.  

**What is a “qualified political party?”**  
- A qualified political party is entitled to participate in any primary election or presidential general election.  
- A political group may qualify as a party in one of two ways: voter registration or petition.  
    - With the voter registration method, the Secretary of State must be able to verify that the political party obtained voter registrations equal in number to .33 percent of the total registration, by the qualification deadline.  
    - With the petition method, the petition submitted to the secretary of state must have signatures of registered voters equal to 10 percent of the votes cast at the last gubernatorial election. The current requirement is 751,398 signatures.

**What are my voting rights if I have a misdemeanor?**  
A misdemeanor conviction does not affect your right to vote at all. You can vote in all elections.  

**What are my voting rights if I have a felony?**  
If you have a felony conviction, **you can vote IF you:**  
- Are on probation, even if you are in county jail as a condition of your probation, or
- You are serving a felony county jail sentence under realignment, or
- Have completed your probation, or
- Are awaiting a judge’s decision on a probation violation, or
- Are on mandatory supervision, or
- Are on post-release community supervision, or
- Are on parole, or
- Have completed your parole.

The only time **you are not allowed to vote is IF you:**  
- Have a felony conviction and you are still in state or federal prison, or
- Are awaiting transfer to a state or federal prison.

Once you have completed your sentence, you can register to vote.  

**Can I vote when I am on parole?**  
Yes. California voters passed Proposition 17 (2020), which restored the right to vote to people on parole.

**Can I vote on mandatory supervision?**  
Yes! You can vote at all times when you are on mandatory supervision.

**Can I vote while I am on post-release community supervision?**  
Yes! You can vote at all times when you are on post-release community supervision.
 
**Can I vote when I am on probation?**  
Yes! You can vote at all times when you are on probation, whether your conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor  

**Can I vote while I am in county jail?**  
Maybe. You **can vote IF** you are in county jail:  
- Awaiting trial for any crime, or
- For a misdemeanor conviction, or
- Serving a felony county jail sentence under realignment
- On a probation or parole violation, or
- On felony probation.

The only time you lose the right to vote while in county jail is when you are *currently serving a state or federal prison sentence* and:  
- In jail awaiting transfer to a state or federal prison, or
- Serving your state prison sentence in county jail because of a contract between CDCR and the county, or
- Temporarily being housed in county jail while awaiting trial in another crime or attending a hearing in an active civil case. 

**How do I get back my right to vote?**  
In California, you do not need to do anything to “restore” your right to vote. It is automatically restored once you have completed your sentence. However, **you must [register or re-register to vote](#section-register-to-vote) in an upcoming election.**

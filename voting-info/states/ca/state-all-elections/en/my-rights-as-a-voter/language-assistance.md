#### What rights do I have for language assistance?  
- Local elections officials are required to provide services and official election materials to bilingual voters in precincts where there are a certain number of people who speak the language.
- In some localities, voter information pamphlets and sample ballots are translated into Chinese, Spanish, Tagalog and Vietnamese, among other languages.
- In some polling places, bilingual poll workers are available to assist voters in their own language.

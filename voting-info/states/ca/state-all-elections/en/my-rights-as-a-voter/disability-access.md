#### What are my rights to access and vote at polling places?  
State and federal laws require polling places to be physically accessible to voters with disabilities.  

#### Access to the polling place  
County elections officials inspect each site and often make temporary modifications to homes, libraries, churches, businesses, schools, or other facilities for Election Day.  

Poll workers are trained on election laws and the rights of voters with disabilities, including the need to make reasonable modifications of policies and procedures to ensure equal access.  

Before each election, every registered voter is notified whether their polling place is accessible. This notification appears  on the Sample Ballot mailed to each voter by their county.  

#### Voting  
The California Secretary of State has approved several voting systems for use that allow voters with disabilities to cast their votes privately and independently.
- Each polling place must have one voting machine that allows voters, including those who are blind or visually impaired, to cast a ballot without assistance.  
	The voting machine permits voters to verify their choices and, if there is an error, allows them to correct those choices before submitting their final ballot.
- Poll workers must provide curbside voting for voters with disabilities who need this assistance.

If you live in one of these Voter’s Choice Act counties, there are big changes as to how you vote. **Amador, Calaveras, Butte, El Dorado, Fresno, Los Angeles, Madera, Mariposa, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Sacramento, San Mateo, Santa Clara, or Tuolumne.**   

If you are registered to vote in any of these counties except Los Angeles County, you will automatically receive a ballot in the mail a few weeks before the election. **Voters in Los Angeles County will not receive your ballot in the mail unless you request one** from your [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact). Most neighborhood polling places will no longer be used for voting. Instead, you will have three choices for how to vote. 

#### 1. Vote By Mail 

You can fill out and mail in your ballot as soon as you receive it. No postage is required to vote by mail.  

#### 2. Ballot Drop Box  

You can drop off your ballot at any secure Ballot Drop Box as soon as you receive it. No postage is required at Ballot Drop Boxes.  

#### 3. Vote Center 

You can vote in person by visiting any Vote Center in your county. At every Vote Center, you can:  
- Vote in person.   
- Drop off your completed ballot.  
- Vote with an accessible voting machine.   
- Get help and voting materials in multiple languages.  
- Register and vote even after the registration deadline has passed, including on Election Day, Tuesday, March 3.   

#### When Vote Centers Are Open

All Vote Centers will be open for at least 4 days before Election Day. For the March 3 Primary, this means all Vote Centers will be open from Saturday, February 29, through Tuesday, March 3. 

Some Vote Centers will be open for 11 days before Election Day. For the March 3 Primary, some Vote Centers will open starting Saturday, February 22.

#### Language Assistance  

Vote Centers will accommodate voters with limited English proficiency. Vote Centers will also have well-trained staff at every location prepared to support voters with translated voting materials in languages required by law. To the greatest extent possible, counties will aim to have multilingual staff and volunteers available to help voters at Vote Centers.  

#### Accessible Voting Places  

All Vote Centers will be accessible to people with disabilities. Counties participating in this program are also required to create a Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee (VAAC) if they do not have one already. A VAAC is made up of voters with disabilities and helps during the planning process to ensure voting is accessible. Please contact your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) to learn more about the specific tools and resources available to people with disabilities.  

Voters with disabilities may request a remote accessible vote-by-mail ballot. You can use this ballot at home with your own computer and assistive technologies, then print the ballot and mail or drop it off.  

#### Why the Change?  

The Voter’s Choice Act is designed to make voting more convenient and accessible.  
- You choose **how** you vote: Whether using the mail, a Ballot Drop Box, or a Vote Center, you choose the method that works best for you. Voters with disabilities may use their own accessible technology to mark their ballot at home.  
- You choose **when** you vote: Instead of just one day to vote, you can vote in person for up to 11 days before the election—even on the weekends.  
- You choose **where** you vote: You can vote at home or at any Vote Center location in your county.  
- You get the **support** you need: Vote Center staff will be there to help you have a great voting experience, including providing assistance in multiple languages and helping voters with disabilities.

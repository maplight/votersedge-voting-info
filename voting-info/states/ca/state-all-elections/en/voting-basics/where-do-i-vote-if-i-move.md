**NEW** Now all Californians can Same-Day Register (or re-register) and vote with a provisional ballot) at **every** voting location in your county. Read more about what you can do if you [missed the deadline to register to vote](#menu-item-missed-the-voter-registration-deadline-you-can-still-register-and-vote). 

**I moved within the same county:**  
- If you moved within 14 days before the election you can vote at the polling place for your old address, but only for that election.  
- You may vote a [provisional ballot](#menu-item-what-is-a-provisional-ballot) at your new [polling place](#section-my-polling-place) or at the [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact).  
You will need to show identification that indicates your new residence and fill out a written confirmation that you’re eligible to vote and registered in the county where you’re voting.  
- If you moved to an address that is assigned to the same polling location as your old address, then no matter when you moved you may vote at that location. However, you **must** confirm your change of address at the polling place.  

**I moved to a new county:**  
- If you moved within 14 days before the election you can vote at the polling place for your old address, but only for that election.

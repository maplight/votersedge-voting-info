Every registered voter in California will receive a ballot in the mail a month before the election. 

**NEW: You can track your ballot by signing up at [Whereâ€™s My Ballot](https://california.ballottrax.net/voter/) or by calling 800-345-VOTE (8683)**. This service will alert you when your ballot is mailed to you, when it is received by your county elections office, and when it is officially counted. You can choose to get emails, text messages, or automated voice messages anytime there is an update to the status of your ballot.

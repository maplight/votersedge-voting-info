**I damaged, lost, or marked my ballot incorrectly. What do I do to fix this?**  

- You can get a new ballot **as long as you have not already cast (voted) your ballot.**  
- **If you vote in-person** ask a poll worker for a new ballot.  
- **If you have your vote-by-mail ballot,** you can turn it in and request a new ballot either at your [county elections office](#menu-item-contact-county-election-office) or polling place.   
- **If you do not have your original vote-by-mail ballot** you can vote using a provisional ballot.

The process to correct a voting mistake is a little different if you live in a [Voter’s Choice](#menu-item-big-changes-in-27-voters-choice-counties) county.As long as you haven’t already voted, you can get a regular ballot at a Vote Center without turning in your vote-by-mail ballot.

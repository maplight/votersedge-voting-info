**I damaged, lost, or marked my ballot incorrectly. What do I do to fix this?**  

- You can get a new ballot **as long as you have not already cast (voted) your ballot.**  
- **If you vote at a polling place** ask a poll worker for a new ballot.  
- **If you have your vote-by-mail ballot,** you can turn it in and request a new ballot either at your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) or polling place.   
- **If you do not have your original vote-by-mail ballot** you can vote using a provisional ballot.   

The process to correct a voting mistake is a little different if you live in a [Voter’s Choice](#menu-item-voters-choice-elections-big-changes-in-madera-napa-nevada-sacramento-and-san-mateo-counties) county (Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Fresno, Los Angeles, Madera, Mariposa, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Sacramento, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Tuolumne). As long as you haven’t already voted, you can get a regular ballot at a Vote Center without turning in your vote-by-mail ballot.

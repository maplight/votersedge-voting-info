Ranked choice voting allows voters to election a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice candidate for a single office. This makes it possible to elect local officials by majority vote without the need for a second run-off election.

**How ranked-choice voting works**:
- To start, every first-choice selection is counted. Any candidate who receives a majority (more than 50%) of the first-choice selections is declared the winner.
- If no candidate receives more than 50% of the first-choice selections, the candidate who received the fewest number of first-choice selections is eliminated.
- Voters who selected the eliminated candidate as their first choice will have their vote transferred to their second choice.
- The votes are then recounted. If any remaining candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, they are declared the winner.
- If no remaining candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, the process of eliminating candidates and transferring votes to the next ranked candidate is repeated until one candidate has a winning majority.

**A provisional ballot is a regular ballot that is put inside of a provisional envelope.** 

**Who must vote a provisional ballot?**  

**Voters who:**  
- Do not appear on the list of voters at the polling place. 
- Moved into a new precinct and did not update their registration.
- Registered by mail, but did not provide a CA drivers license number, CA ID number or the last 4 digits of their Social Security Number when they registered.
- Return vote-by-mail ballots to the polls without an envelope.
- Vote by mail, but decide that they would prefer to vote in person and do not bring their vote-by-mail ballot to turn in at the polling place.
- Register too late for their names to be printed on the list of voters.  

For a more extensive list of people who must vote with a provisional ballot, check the [California Secretary of State](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/provisional-voting/).

**Are all provisional ballots counted?**  
If voters are eligible to vote and vote provisionally, their ballots will be counted.  

**What if I go to the wrong polling place and have to vote a provisional ballot, will my ballot still be counted?**  
Firstly, you must always vote in the county where you are registered to vote.  
If you're in the right county but the wrong polling place, then all of the candidates and measures that are on the ballot you were supposed to vote on, if you had gone to the correct location, will be counted.  

But any contests and measures that are not also on the ballot at your correct polling place will not be counted.  

**How are provisional ballots handled?**  
- Fill out your name and current address on the provisional envelope and sign it. 
- After the polls close, the ballot is returned to the election office, where the information on the envelope is verified against the voter registration records.  
- If the information that the voter has written on the envelope matches, then the ballot is removed from the envelope and counted.  

**Can I check the status of my provisional ballot?**  
You may contact the [county elections office](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/county-elections-offices/) to learn whether your provisional ballot was counted and if it was not counted, the reason why.

If it is **six or fewer days before Election Day,** you may be able to get an emergency vote-by-mail ballot.  

**Situations where emergency ballots are available:**  
You can make a written request for this ballot if you:  
- Are hospitalized, in a nursing home, sanatorium, or in your residence and you are too sick to get to the polling place.
- Have a physical handicap that causes you to be unable to get to your polling place.
- Have a physical handicap that makes you unable to vote at your polling place due to architectural barriers denying you physical access to the polling place, voting booth, or voting apparatus or machinery.
- Are unable to go to your polling place because of conditions resulting in your absence from the precinct on Election Day.

**How do I make the emergency request?**  
Make a written request. Your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) might have a pre-printed form for you to use.  
- The Secretary of State also offers a form that can be used to give someone permission (“authorization”) to pick up a new vote-by-mail ballot for you, you must fill out a form called “[Application to Provide Vote-by-Mail Ballot to Representative](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail#late).”
- Once you recieve the ballot, mark it as directed and return the ballot in the same manner that you return any vote-by-mail ballot. For detailed instructions check [How do I vote by mail?](#menu-item-vote-by-mail)  

Or, if you are able, you can go to your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) during open hours and [vote early in person.](#menu-item-vote-early-in-person)

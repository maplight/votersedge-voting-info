Certain candidates in California are elected in a “Top-Two Primary.” These include candidates for:  
- U.S. Senate  
- U.S. Representative  
- State Senate  
- State Assembly  
- Governor and Lt. Governor  
- Treasurer  
- Secretary of State  
- Attorney General  
- Controller  
- Insurance Commissioner  
- Board of Equalization  

In a Top-Two Primary, you can cast your vote for any candidate.  
- All candidates from all parties will be on the ballot for these contests.  
- You don’t have to be registered with a party to vote on these contests.  
- You can vote for a candidate from any party.  
- You can “write in” a candidate in the Primary Election.  
- The two candidates with the most votes will appear on the General Election ballot even if they have the same party preference.  

**Nonpartisan offices:** Judges, County Supervisor, other County and Municipal offices, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction are always open to all eligible voters.  

**What does party preference mean?**  
Voters may either register with a political party preference or choose "none."
A candidate's party preference does not necessarily mean that they have that political party's support. The list of candidates who receive a party's official endorsement (support) is in the county Voter Information Guide.

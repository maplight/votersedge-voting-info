**Take a look at [Do you want to vote for President?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0h2E_kd8S-LemNBUGhaWTZXamRqQnRXb1pNMXFjeVZ4eWJz/view?usp=sharing)**  

**Six political parties are holding presidential primaries:**    
- American Independent Party  
- Democratic Party  
- Green Party  
- Libertarian Party  
- Peace and Freedom Party  
- Republican Party  

**If you are registered with one of these parties,** your ballot will include the candidates running for that party’s nomination.  

If you are registered with one political party, you may not vote a ballot for another political party.  

You can only vote for the County Central Committees/County Councils if you are registered with that party.  

If you are not registered with one of the six political parties, or if you registered Decline to State, Independent, or Nonpartisan, then you are a **No Party Preference (NPP) Voter.** Click [here](#menu-item-how-do-i-vote-for-president-if-i-am-registered-as-no-party-preference?) for more detailed information about how to vote if you are registered as No Party Preference.  

**Three parties allow NPP voters to vote in their presidential primary:**  
- American Independent Party  
- Democratic Party  
- Libertarian Party  

If you want to vote in one of these party primaries, you must ask for that ballot.  Otherwise you will receive a Nonpartisan ballot that will not include the office of president.  

**Three parties allow only voters registered with their party to vote in their presidential primary:**  
- Green Party  
- Peace and Freedom Party  
- Republican Party  

**If you want to change your party registration before the primary,** then you **must** [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) and select that party. The last day to re-register to vote is May 23, 2016. You can always re-register again after the primary as either a “No Party Preference” voter or with any political party.

The next Presidential Primary is June 7, 2016.  

When you register to vote, you decide if you want to choose a "political party." There are six qualified political parties in California. They are:  
- American Independent Party  
- Democratic Party  
- Green Party  
- Libertarian Party  
- Peace and Freedom Party  
- Republican Party  
Or you can register without choosing a political party.  

The choices you make when you register will determine which candidates for President appear on your ballot.  

**If you are registered to vote with a political party,** you will be given a ballot for that party in a Presidential primary election, and you will be able to choose one of the candidates in that party.  

**If you registered without choosing a political party,** there will NOT be any presidential candidates on your ballot, but it will contain candidates for all other contests and ballot measures.    

Even if you register without choosing a political party, there is still a way you can vote for a candidate for President:  
- Three of the political parties, American Independent, Democratic, and Libertarian, will allow voters with  “no party preference” to ask for their ballots in the June 7 election.  
- But if you want to vote on presidential candidates for the Green, Peace & Freedom, or Republican Party  then you must [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) and select that party. Just make sure you [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) by the May 23 deadline. You can always [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) again after the primary as either a "no party preference" voter or with any political party.

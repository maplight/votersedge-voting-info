**Take a look at [Do you want to vote for President?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EPQazrB7nQlvZkIOtILqhttTbFofRF61/view?usp=sharing)**  

**Six political parties are holding presidential primaries:**    
- American Independent Party  
- Democratic Party  
- Green Party  
- Libertarian Party  
- Peace and Freedom Party  
- Republican Party  

**If you are registered with one of these parties,** your ballot will include the candidates running for that party’s nomination.  

If you are registered with one political party, you may not vote a ballot for another political party.  

You can only vote for the County Central Committees/County Councils if you are registered with that party.  

*If you are not registered with one of the six political parties, or if you registered Decline to State, Independent*, or Nonpartisan, then you are a **No Party Preference (NPP) Voter.** Click [here](#menu-item-how-do-i-vote-for-president-in-the-primary-if-i-am-registered-as-no-party-preference) for more detailed information about how to vote if you are registered as No Party Preference.

Please note - the American Independent Party is a political party in California with its own platform. If you are registered with the American Independent Party then you are **not** registered as a No Party Preference voter.   

**Three parties allow NPP voters to vote in their presidential primary:**  
- American Independent Party  
- Democratic Party  
- Libertarian Party  

If you want to vote in one of these party primaries, you must ask for that ballot. Otherwise you will receive a nonpartisan ballot that will not include the office of president.  

**Three parties allow only voters registered with their party to vote in their presidential primary:**  
- Green Party  
- Peace and Freedom Party  
- Republican Party  

**If you want to change your party registration before the primary,** then you **should** [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) and select that party. The last day to re-register to vote is 15 days before the election. **NEW** Even if you miss that deadline, with [Same-Day registration and voting](#menu-item-missed-the-voter-registration-deadline-you-can-still-register-and-vote), you may now change your party registration all the way through Election Day and vote with a provisional ballot.

You can always re-register again after the primary as either a “No Party Preference” voter or with any political party.

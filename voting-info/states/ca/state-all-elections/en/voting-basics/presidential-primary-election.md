The next Presidential Primary is June 7, 2016.  

**If you are registered to vote with a political party,** you will be given a ballot for that party in a Presidential primary election.  

**If you checked "I do not want to disclose a political party preference"** on the voter registration form, you will not get a ballot containing the names of candidates running for president. You will get a ballot containing all the other races and ballot measures.  

**-OR-** If **you checked "I do not want to disclose a political party preference"** on the voter registration form, **you can request the ballot** of one of the following parties when you are at the polling place or in your request for a vote-by-mail ballot:  
- Anerican Independent Party  
- Democratic Party  
- Libertarian Party  

**What if I registered with no party preference and I want to vote in the Green, Peace and Freedom, or Republican Presidential Primary?**  

If you registered with no party preference, and you want to vote for a Primary candidate in the Green, Peace and Freedom, or Republican Party, then you must [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) as member of the party. You may [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) as a member of one of these parties by May 23, 2016. You can always [re-register](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) again after the primary as either a “no party preference” voter or with any political party.

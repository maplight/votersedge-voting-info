Disability Rights California (DRC) will operate a [toll-free hotline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0h2E_kd8S-LY0VuMjIyMzlRR21tMEs3OVpMRjlxdTRBTF9B/view?usp=sharing) on Primary Election Day, June 7, for voters with disabilities. The service is designed to help those who have difficulty accessing polling places, casting ballots or simply have questions about voting. **The toll-free number for voice calls is 888-569-7955. The statewide number for video calls is 800-719-5798.**  

**Accessible information**  

The state [Official Voter Information Guide](http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/) that is mailed to each registered voter is available in a downloadable MP3 [audio version](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voters-disabilities/), audio cassettes, in American Sign Language, and in large print. You may call (800) 345-8683 to request these versions.  

The California Secretary of State also maintains a Voter Hotline for voters who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech-impaired at: (800) 833-8683 - TTY/TDD  

**Accessible voting places**  

Before each election, registered voters are notified as to whether or not their polling places are accessible. This notification appears on the Sample Ballot mailed by your county. 

**Signing in at the polling place**  

[You can vote even if you can't sign your name](http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/pubs/547301.pdf)!  

**Accessible voting machines**  

Each polling place must have one voting machine that allows voters, including those who are blind or visually impaired, to cast a ballot without assistance.  

The voting machine permits voters to privately and independently verify vote choices and, if there is an error, allows them to correct those choices before submitting their final ballot.  

**Voting Assistance**  

You may choose up to two people to help in the polling place. However, the person who provides assistance may not be:  
- Your employer or someone who works for your employer; or  
- Your labor union leader or someone who works for your labor union.  

**Curbside voting**  

Poll workers must provide curbside voting for voters with disabilities who need this assistance. Parking for curbside voting will be provided as close as possible to the voting area.   

A poll worker will bring the list to sign, the ballot, and other required materials to the voterâ€™s car.  The poll worker will take everything back into the polling place and put the ballot in the ballot box or scanner.

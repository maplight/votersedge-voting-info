If you’re registered as No Party Preference (NPP) but you want to vote for president in the *Green, Peace and Freedom, or Republican parties*, then you must re-register and select that party. The last day to re-register to vote is Monday, October 19, 2020. 

**NEW** Now all Californians can [Same-Day Register (or re-register)](#menu-item-missed-the-voter-registration-deadline-you-can-still-register-and-vote), change their political party, and vote with a provisional ballot at every voting location in your county.

If you’re registered as No Party Preference (NPP) but you want to vote for president in the *American Independent, Democratic, or Libertarian Party*, then here are your options:  

**Vote-by-Mail**  
- **Apply** for a vote-by-mail ballot **before October 19, 2020.** [Download](http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/vote-by-mail/pdf/vote-by-mail-application.pdf), print and fill out the application.  
- **Mark** box #7 and write in the name of the party on the application.  
- **Mail** the application directly to your [county elections office.](#section-election-office-contact)  

  -OR-  
  
- **Go** to your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) or a Vote Center (if your county has them) to request a vote-by-mail ballot.  
- **Cast your new vote-by-mail ballot** as you would any other [vote-by mail ballot](#menu-item-vote-by-mail).  
- **Note: Return the new vote-by-mail ballot in the envelope that came with the new ballot.** Do not use the old ballot or the old envelope. The old ballot is void and will not be counted. A new ballot in an old envelope will also not be counted.

- Note: If you have a vote-by-mail ballot take it and its return envelope with you to give it to the elections officials. If you do not bring the old ballot and envelope, you will receive a [provisional ballot](#menu-item-what-is-a-provisional-ballot) that will be counted after it is confirmed that your old ballot was not cast.  

**At the Polls on Election Day, November 3, 2020**

**If you re-registered after you received a vote-by-mail ballot:**  
- If you re-registered after receiving a vote-by-mail ballot, and you asked for vote-by-mail status during the re-registration, then a new vote-by-mail ballot will be mailed to you.  
- Return the new vote-by-mail ballot in the envelope that came with the new ballot. Do not use the old ballot or the old envelope. The old ballot is void and will not be counted. A new ballot in an old envelope will also not be counted.  
- Mail your ballot. Be sure it is postmarked on or before November 3, 2020.

A recall election decides whether or not an elected official will be removed from the elected job, and who will replace that official.

#### How Does a Recall Election Work  

There will be two questions on the ballot that every eligible Californian can vote on: 
1. Do you want to recall the governor (remove him from office)?
2. If the governor is recalled, who do you want to replace him?

If the majority (more than 50%) of voters say “no” to the first question, **the governor remains in office**. If the majority of voters say “yes” to the first question, **the person who gets the most votes on the second question becomes the governor**.

**A replacement candidate does NOT need more than 50% of the votes to win**, they simply need more votes than any of the other candidates.

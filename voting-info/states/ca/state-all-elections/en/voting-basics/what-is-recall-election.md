A recall election decides whether or not an elected official will be removed from the elected job, and who will replace that official.

#### How Does a Recall Election Work  

For the **September 14, California Governor Recall Election**, there will be two questions on the ballot that every eligible Californian can vote on: 
**1.** Do you want to recall the governor (remove him from office)?
**2.** If the governor is recalled, who do you want to replace him?

**You do not need to vote on both questions**. You may cast a vote for either question or both.

If more than 50% of voters say “no” to the first question, **the governor remains in office**. If more than 50% of voters say “yes” to the first question, **the person who gets the most votes on the second question becomes the governor**. 

**A replacement candidate does NOT need more than 50% of the votes to win**, they simply need more votes than any of the other candidates.

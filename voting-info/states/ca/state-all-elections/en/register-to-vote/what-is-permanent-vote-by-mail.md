When you register you can choose to have vote-by-mail ballots (“absentee” ballots) automatically sent to you for every election.  

If you are already registered, you may also contact your [county elections office](#section-election-office-contact) to change your status to be a permanent vote-by-mail voter. 

For more information, check [How do I vote by mail?](#menu-item-vote-by-mail)

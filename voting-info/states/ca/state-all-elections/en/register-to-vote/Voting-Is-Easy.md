#### 2. Get Ready!

- All registered voters receive [two things](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/publications-and-resources/state-county-vig/) in the mail: 
  - A county Voter Information Guide that lists everything that will be on your ballot along with where you vote.
  - An Official Voter Information Guide about statewide candidates and measures.
- You can use this Voter's Edge California site for more information about everything on your ballot plus a handy way to find your [polling place](#section-my-polling-place). 

#### 3. Vote!

**This year, if you are already registered to vote, you will receive a ballot in the mail.** You choose whether to vote in person at your voting location, or return the ballot you received either by mail or by dropping it off.  
**By Mail**. If you wish to use the mailed ballot instead of voting in person, fill it out and mail it back early so that it is postmarked no later than Election Day. 
**Or Dropoff**. You may drop off your ballot at any voting location in your county. Your county may also open secure ballot drop box locations starting about a month before Election Day.
**Or In Person**. For voting in person on Tuesday, November 3, the polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
**Early Voting**. You may also be able to vote in person before Election Day. Check [caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov](https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/).

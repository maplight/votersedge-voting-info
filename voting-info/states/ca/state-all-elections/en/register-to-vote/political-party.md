**You have a choice.**  
- You may choose among [qualified political parties](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/political-parties/qualified-political-parties/) or choose “other,”  
- **OR** If you do not want to register as a member of a political party you can mark the box next to “No, I do not want to disclose a political party preference” on the voter registration form.  
- Your choice to register with no party preference may affect your ability to vote in a **June Primary Election** for U.S. President and County Central Committees (party nominated offices), but you will still be able to vote for other offices and measures on the ballot.  
- You may register with no party preference and still vote for any candidate on the ballot in the **November General Election.**

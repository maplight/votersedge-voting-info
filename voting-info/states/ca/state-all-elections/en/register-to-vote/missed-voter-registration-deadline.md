Even if you missed the voter registration deadline, it isn't too late to vote. 

**Same-day register and vote in person**. 
To register up to and on Election Day, go to any voting location  and complete three simple steps: 
	1. **Register** to vote. 
	2. **Vote.**
	3. **Seal** your ballot in the provided envelope, and **sign** it.

You can do this at any voting location in your county, but if you go to
your assigned location, then your ballot will be sure to include all the contests on which youâ€™re allowed to vote. Check your [polling location](#section-my-polling-place).

This is called Conditional Voter Registration (CVR) or Same-Day Registration. Your vote will be counted after elections officials verify your voter registration and confirm that you have not already voted in this election. 

Check [here](https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov) to find locations where you can register and vote at the same time - starting early and going all the way up through Election Day! 

**Same-day register and vote from home**. 
If you need to register after the deadline and want to vote from home, contact your [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact) to find out how to register and get a vote by mail ballot through Election Day.

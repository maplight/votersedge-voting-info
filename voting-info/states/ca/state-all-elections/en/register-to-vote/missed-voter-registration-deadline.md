Even if you missed the voter registration deadline, it isn't too late to vote. To register up to and on Election Day, go to your [polling location](#section-election-office-contact), vote center, or elections office, and complete three simple steps: 

  1. **Register** to vote. 
  2. **Vote.**
  3. **Seal** your ballot in the provided envelope, and **sign** it.

You can do this at any polling location in your county, but if you go to the place that you're assigned, then they will be sure to have the ballot with all of your assigned contests. 

This is called Conditional Voter Registration (CVR) or Same-Day Registration. Your vote will be counted after elections officials verify your voter registration and confirm that you have not already voted in this election. 

Check [here](https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov) to find locations where you can register and vote at the same time--all the way up through Election Day! 

After the election, check the [Secretary of State's website](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-status/) or call 800-345-VOTE (8683) to learn how to see whether your ballot was counted. If it wasn't counted, you'll also be able to see the reason why.

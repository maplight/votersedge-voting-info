Even if you missed the voter registration deadline, it isn't too late to vote. To register up to and on Election Day, go to your [county elections office](#menu-item-contact-county-election-office) or another designated location, and complete three simple steps:  

  1. **Register** to vote.
  2. **Vote.**
  3. **Seal** your ballot in the provided envelope, and **sign** it.   

This is called Conditional Voter Registration (CVR) or Same-Day Registration. Your vote will be counted after elections officials verify your voter registration and confirm that you have not already voted in this election.  

After the election, check the [Secretary of State's website](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-status/) or call 800-345-VOTE (8683) to learn how to see whether your ballot was counted. If it wasn't counted, you'll also be able to see the reason why.

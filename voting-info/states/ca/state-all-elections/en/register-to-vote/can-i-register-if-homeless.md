**Yes, you can register if you are unhoused or experiencing homelessness if**:  
- You have a fixed location where you can be assigned to a voting precinct. You must describe your location using cross streets, landmarks, or other information to explain where you live.  
- **AND** you have a place where you can receive mail, such as a post office box or shelter.

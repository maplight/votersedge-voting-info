In order to vote in the election, you must register to vote **no later than 15 days before the election.**  

It is important that your voter registration application be filled out completely and:  
- Submitted online no later than 15 days before the election;
- **OR** postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office no later than 15 days before the election.

Even if you missed the voter registration deadline, it isn't too late to vote. With [Same-Day Voter Registration](#menu-item-missed-the-voter-registration-deadline-you-can-still-register-and-vote), you can register up to and on Election Day. 

You can also [check the status of your voter registration](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/registration-status/) to make sure youâ€™re registered.

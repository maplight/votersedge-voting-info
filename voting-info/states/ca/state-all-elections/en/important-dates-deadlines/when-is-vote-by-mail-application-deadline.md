Now every registered voter gets a ballot mailed without any need to send in an application. However, if you register to vote after the Monday, October 24 deadline and would like to vote by mail, it is best to try to register **no later than November 1** to allow your elections office to mail you a ballot in time. You should also contact your elections office to let them know you registered late and would like a ballot mailed to you.

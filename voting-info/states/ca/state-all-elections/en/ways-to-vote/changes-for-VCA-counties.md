This year you have options to vote safely and easily. **Every registered voter in California will receive a ballot in the mail** a month before the election.

**There are 3 ways to vote**. You can choose to mail back your ballot, drop it off, or you can vote in person. Your in-person voting location may be different than the one you usually visit. 

**Get ready for your mailed ballot**
- **Register** to vote no later than May 23, 2022 at [registertovote.ca.gov](https://registertovote.ca.gov//).
Check your registration to make sure itâ€™s up to date. 
- **If your signature has changed** over time, then re-register to update your signature at [voterstatus.sos.ca.gov](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/).
- If you want to get **voting materials in a language other than English**, make that choice at [voterstatus.sos.ca.gov](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/).

If you live in one of these Voter’s Choice Act counties, there are big changes as to how you vote. **Amador, Calaveras, Butte, El Dorado, Fresno, Los Angeles, Madera, Mariposa, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Sacramento, San Mateo, Santa Clara, or Tuolumne.** 

- You will automatically receive your ballot in the mail a few weeks before the election.  
- Most neighborhood polling places will no longer be used for voting.    
- Instead, you will have three choices for how to vote:  
  - Mail back your ballot,  
  - Drop it off at any secure Ballot Dropbox, or  
  - Vote in person at a Vote Center.  

**Voters in Los Angeles County will not receive your ballot in the mail unless you request one** from your [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact).

Find your Vote Center or Ballot Drop Box location [here](https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/)!  

In order to receive a ballot in the mail, you must register by the deadline, which is 15 days before an election. The registration deadline for the Tuesday, March 3, primary election is Tuesday, February 18. 

Missed the deadline? You can still register and vote at a Vote Center, all the way up to and including Election Day.

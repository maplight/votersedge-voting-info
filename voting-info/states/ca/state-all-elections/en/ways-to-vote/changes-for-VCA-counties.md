If you live in **Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento, or San Mateo counties** there are big changes to how you vote starting this year:  

- You will automatically receive your ballot in the mail a few weeks before the election.  
- Most neighborhood polling places will no longer be used for voting.    
- Instead, you will have three choices for how to vote:  
  - Mail back your ballot,  
  - Drop it off at any secure Ballot Dropbox, or  
  - Vote in person at a Vote Center.  

(Other counties may put this system in place starting in 2020.) 

In order to receive a ballot in the mail, you must register by the deadline, which is 15 days before an election. The registration deadline for the Tuesday, June 5, primary election is Monday, May 21. 

Missed the deadline? You can still register and vote at a Vote Center, all the way up to and including Election Day.

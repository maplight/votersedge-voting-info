**How do I vote at the polling place or vote center in person?**  

Polling places are open from 7 AM to 8 PM on **Election Day, Tuesday, November 3, 2020**.  

_[Vote Centers](#menu-item-big-changes-in-15-voters-choice-counties) in the 15 Voterâ€™s Choice Act counties are open before Election Day and will also be open from 7 AM to 8 PM on Election Day._

**How do I find my polling place?**   

- If you provided your voting address, then your polling location is printed here in the [My Voting Location](#section-my-polling-place) section of this site.  
- You can find your polling place location on the back of the Voter Information Guide mailed to you by your county; or,  
- You can contact your [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact) to find your polling place.  
- You can text "Vote" to GOVOTE (468683); or  
- You can call (800) 345-VOTE (8683) and choose option 5.  

**What are the basic steps for voting in person?**  

**Go to the registration table**. Say your name and address and sign the list of voters. A poll worker will give you a ballot.  

**For paper ballots**  

- **Mark (fill out)** your ballot by following the instructions.  
- **Tear off** the stub at the top of the ballot. You may use this stub later to check that your ballot was counted.  
- To preserve the secrecy of your vote you will **place your ballot** in an envelope or folder, or fold it if instructed by your county.  
- **Cast** your ballot by following the procedures required by your county.  
- **Put your ballot** into either a ballot box or a scanner if your polling location uses a scanner.  

**For touchscreen voting machines**  

Not all California counties use the same type of touchscreen voting machines.  
- The poll worker will give you either a unique passcode or a computer memory card to gain access to the type of touchscreen in your county.  
- Follow the instructions on the machine.  
- If you have questions, ask a poll worker.

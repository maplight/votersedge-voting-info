**In Person Voting Tip**

- If you choose to vote in person, it may help to bring the ballot that was mailed to you.
- If you don’t bring your mailed ballot, some counties will require you to vote using a provisional ballot that will be counted once elections officials check that you are eligible to vote.
- If you live in one of the following “Voter’s Choice” counties, you can get a regular ballot at any Vote Center, even if you didn’t bring the ballot that was mailed to you: Alameda, Amador, Calaveras, Butte, El Dorado, Fresno, Kings, Los Angeles, Madera, Marin, Mariposa, Merced, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Diego, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Ventura, and Yolo. For more information check the [California Secretary State's website](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voters-choice-act/).

**How do I find my polling place?**   

- If you provided your voting address, then your polling location is printed here in the [My Voting Location](#section-my-polling-place) section of this site.  
- You can find your polling place location on the back of the Voter Information Guide mailed to you by your county; or,  
- You can contact your [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact) to find your polling place.  
- You can text "Vote" to GOVOTE (468683); or  
- You can call (800) 345-VOTE (8683) and choose option 5.  

**What are the basic steps for voting in person?**  

**Go to the registration table**. Say your name and address and sign the list of voters. A poll worker will give you a ballot.  

**For paper ballots**  

- **Mark (fill out)** your ballot by following the instructions.  
- **Tear off** the stub at the top of the ballot. You may use this stub later to check that your ballot was counted.  
- You will **place your ballot** in an envelope or folder, or fold it if instructed by your county.   
- **Cast** your ballot by following the procedures required by your county.  
- **Put your ballot** into either a ballot box or a scanner if your polling location uses a scanner.  

**For touchscreen voting machines**  

Not all California counties use the same type of touchscreen voting machines.  
- The poll worker will give you either a unique passcode or a computer memory card to gain access to the type of touchscreen in your county.  
- Follow the instructions on the machine.  
- If you have questions, ask a poll worker.

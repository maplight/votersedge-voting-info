**How do I vote at the polling place in person?**  
Polling places are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.  

**How do I find my polling place?**   
- If you provided your voting address, then your polling location is printed here in the [My Polling Place](#section-my-polling-place) section of this site.  
- You can find your polling place location on the back of the Sample Ballot (or Voter Information Guide) mailed to you by your county; or,  
- You can contact your [County Elections Office](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/county-elections-offices/) to find your polling place.  
- You can text "Vote" to GOVOTE (468683); or  
- You can call (800) 345-VOTE (8683) and choose option 5.  

**What are the basic steps for voting in person?**  

**Go to the registration table**. Say your name and address and sign the list of voters. A poll worker will give you a ballot.  

**For paper ballots**  
 - **Mark (fill out)** your ballot by following the instructions.  
 - **Tear off** the stub at the top of the ballot. You may use this stub later to check that your ballot was counted.  
 - To preserve the secrecy of your vote you will **place your ballot** in an envelope or folder, or fold it if instructed by your county.  
 - **Cast** your ballot by following the procedures required by your county.  
 - **Put your ballot** into either a ballot box or a scanner if your polling location uses a scanner.  

**For touchscreen voting machines**  

Not all California counties use the same type of touchscreen voting machines.  
 - The poll worker will give you either a unique passcode or a computer memory card to gain access to the type of touchscreen in your county.  
 - Follow the instructions on the machine.  
 - If you have questions, ask a poll worker.

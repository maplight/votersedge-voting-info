> Polling places are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.  

If you provided your voting address, then your polling location is printed here in the [My Polling Place](#item-my-polling-place) section of this site.  

Or, you can contact your [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact) to find your polling place.  

**What are the basic steps for voting in person?**  

**Go to the registration table**. Say your name and address and sign the list of voters. A poll worker will give you a ballot.  

**For paper ballots**  
 1. **Mark (fill out)** your ballot by following the instructions.  
 2. **Tear off** the stub at the top of the ballot. You may use this stub later to check that your ballot was counted.  
 3. To preserve the secrecy of your vote you will **place your ballot** in an envelope or folder, or fold it if instructed by your county.  
 4. **Cast** your ballot by following the procedures required by your county.  
 5. **Put your ballot** into either a ballot box or a scanner if your polling location uses a scanner.  

**For touchscreen voting machines**  

Not all California counties use the same type of touchscreen voting machines.  
 1. The poll worker will give you either a unique passcode or a computer memory card to gain access to the type of touchscreen in your county.  
 2. Follow the instructions on the machine.  
 3. If you have questions, ask a poll worker.

Your voting location may be different this year. Counties are working to provide the best options for safe, socially distanced, in-person voting. **Please wear a mask when you vote in person!**

At in-person Voting Locations you can:
- Vote in person
- Drop off your completed ballot
- Vote with an accessible voting machine
- Get help and voting materials in multiple languages.

**How do I vote at the polling place or vote center in person?**  

- Polling places are open from 7 AM to 8 PM on **Election Day, Tuesday, November 3, 2020**.  

- Early voting, starting before Election Day, will be available in some locations. Find Early Voting and Ballot Dropbox locations at [caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov](https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/).

**In Person Voting Tip**

- If you choose to vote in person, it may help to bring the ballot that was mailed to you.
- If you don’t bring your mailed ballot, some counties will require you to vote using a provisional ballot that will be counted once elections officials check that you are eligible to vote.
- If you live in one of the following “Voter’s Choice” counties, you can get a regular ballot at any Vote Center, even if you didn’t bring the ballot that was mailed to you: Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, Los Angeles, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Sacramento, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Tuolumne. For more information check the [California Secretary State](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voters-choice-act/).

**How do I find my polling place?**   

- If you provided your voting address, then your polling location is printed here in the [My Voting Location](#section-my-polling-place) section of this site.  
- You can find your polling place location on the back of the Voter Information Guide mailed to you by your county; or,  
- You can contact your [County Elections Office](#section-election-office-contact) to find your polling place.  
- You can text "Vote" to GOVOTE (468683); or  
- You can call (800) 345-VOTE (8683) and choose option 5.  

**What are the basic steps for voting in person?**  

**Go to the registration table**. Say your name and address and sign the list of voters. A poll worker will give you a ballot.  

**For paper ballots**  

- **Mark (fill out)** your ballot by following the instructions.  
- **Tear off** the stub at the top of the ballot. You may use this stub later to check that your ballot was counted.  
- To preserve the secrecy of your vote you will **place your ballot** in an envelope or folder, or fold it if instructed by your county.  
- **Cast** your ballot by following the procedures required by your county.  
- **Put your ballot** into either a ballot box or a scanner if your polling location uses a scanner.  

**For touchscreen voting machines**  

Not all California counties use the same type of touchscreen voting machines.  
- The poll worker will give you either a unique passcode or a computer memory card to gain access to the type of touchscreen in your county.  
- Follow the instructions on the machine.  
- If you have questions, ask a poll worker.

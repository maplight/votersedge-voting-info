Follow the instructions in Vote by Mail (bookmark to section above) to fill out your ballot and envelope. 

If you decide to hand in your ballot instead of mailing it, you must drop it off **no later than
8PM on Election Day, November 3**.
Drop off your ballot at any voting location in your county.
Some counties will also offer secure Ballot Dropboxes. 
For details and locations check [caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov](https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/).

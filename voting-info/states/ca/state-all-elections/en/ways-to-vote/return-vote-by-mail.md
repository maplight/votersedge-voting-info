Follow the instructions in [Vote by Mail](#menu-item-vote-by-mail) to fill out your ballot and envelope. 

If you decide to hand in your ballot instead of mailing it, you must drop it off **no later than
8PM on Election Day**.
- Drop off your ballot at any voting location in your county.
- Some counties will also offer secure Ballot Dropboxes or ballot dropoff locations. 

For details and locations check [caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov](https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/).

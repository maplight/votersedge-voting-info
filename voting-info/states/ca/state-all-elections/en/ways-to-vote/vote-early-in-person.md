You may be able to vote in person either at your [County Elections Office](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/county-elections-offices/) or at another early voting location before Election Day. Some early voting locations are also open through Election Day.  

**In-Person Voting Tip**
- If you choose to vote in person, it may help to bring the ballot that was mailed to you.
- If you don’t bring your mailed ballot, some counties will require you to vote using a provisional ballot that will be counted once elections officials check that you are eligible to vote.
- If you live in one of the following “Voter’s Choice” counties, you can get a regular ballot at any Vote Center, even if you didn’t bring the ballot that was mailed to you: Alameda, Amador, Calaveras, Butte, El Dorado, Fresno, Kings, Los Angeles, Madera, Marin, Mariposa, Merced, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Diego, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Ventura, and Yolo. For more information check the [California Secretary State's website](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voters-choice-act/).

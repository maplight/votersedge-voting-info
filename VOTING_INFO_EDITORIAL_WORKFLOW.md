We have several content writers adding content for sections of the voting information section.

### Voting information section content contribution workflow
November 2015-January 15, 2015

We have a very lightweight content contribution system while we are understanding all of the kind of information that makes sense to publish for the state, for a county, or by an election. We expect to train our volunteers sometime in January with our system, but in the meantime, we just want to know what information you need to share with voters.

### Statewide content editors
If you are writing content that applies to the whole state of California, we will share a Dropbox folder with statewide content, and you will be able to contribute new templates. Please keep formatting to a minimum, and if at all possible, please provide us with markdown files or please send your content coordinator share a google doc with us. If that is too difficult, then just send us text in an email or in a word doc and we will convert it for this first early pass at the online voting information section.


### Template
For the time being, we have a template you can follow. If you can provide us with markdown files instead of Word documents, that would be really appreciated. 


Please include in your file:

title: The name of your section. This is what will appear as a menu link.
published: true or false. True means this is ready to be published.
weight: a number between 0 and 100, where 100 will appear first, and lower numbers, like 30 or 20 are less important.
priority: should be "Minor" unless you are a state content editor.
county: please include your county name
state: please include your state name


Here is an example.
-- beginning of file --


---
title: "Election calendar"
published: true
weight: 0
section: when-to-vote
priority: Minor
county: Alameda County
state: California
---
Your section content goes here




-- end of file -- 




### SECTIONS
We have 8 sections, or categories, right now. You may contribute content to subsections in these categories. 
      'where-to-vote' 
      'register-to-vote'
      'how-to-vote'
      'when-to-vote'
      'important-dates-deadlines'
      'voting-basics'
      'my-rights-as-a-voter'
      'other-topics'


### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple language for formatting text for the web. It uses simple formatting like **this should be bold** to write. Here are the formatting tips. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

If you would prefer to use a tool that will format it for you with a button, this free-online tool that allows you to write markdown formatted text. https://stackedit.io/editor 

All you really need to write Markdown is a text editor (*not microsoft word!*)
There are other tools such as Mou, Retext.

We also have a really awesome tool called Prose.io which our state content editors and tech team will be using to finalize the content before it is pushed to the web.

### Previews
You will be able to preview content sometime in mid-January. For now, please bear with us.

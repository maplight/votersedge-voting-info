  "readme": "Voter's Edge Voting info Guide\nThis is the document folder for the voting info guide for Voter's Edge.\nThese pages are stored in an online repository and can be synced by an administrator and published to the web, or could be set up to automatically publish to the web after passing tests.\n-----------\n\nSpec: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rZfuKUD7lHf3IUesz7YzwL6eXwg7L0ttSb4FGlcmb8/edit\n\n\n### State content folder\nThis contains all of the default content we provide, for each statewide election. \n* There are default pages, and state-wide override files. \n* The default pages should be written generically.\n\n#### File names are as follows\n\nname-of-url.jade  — This would apply to all states.\nname-of-url.ca.jade — This would override the default page and be used on california only.\n\nExample:\n\nThese files are present:\nwhere-do-i-vote.jade\nwhere-do-i-vote.ca.jade\nwhere-do-i-vote.ny.jade\n\nIn this case, Illinois would use the default page.\n\n\n### Page strucutre\nThe files are currently in Jade format. http://jade-lang.com/reference/code/\n\nThis includes a header, that speaks to the server, and the content within the section. You do not need to include the header title. That will be handled automatically.\n\n\n* if Jade is too complicated, we can try using markdown.\n* Jade uses abbreviated html syntax.\n\n\n\n#### Header values\n\n##### Url or anchor tag\ncontrolled by the filename\n\n##### Title\nIs the header name\n* Should be written in easy to understand language\n* 8th grade reading level\n* Max 6 words\n\n##### Published\nControls if a page should be rendered as published or not. \n\nValues: \nUnpublished\nPublished\n\n##### Weight\nControls the order of the content\nValues\nrange from -100 to 100\nEx. -10\nValues that are lower will appear lower than the other values.\n\n##### Priority\nControls if a piece of content is a section or subsection\n\nValues:\nMajor\nMinor\n\n##### No Override\nControls if content should not override state or default content. Will override by default.\n\nValue:\nYes\n\n###### Section\nWe have 6 sections. \nWeights for major sections control the sections\n\nValues\nWhere do I vote?\nRegister to vote\nVoting Basics\nHow do I vote?\nWhen do I vote?\nOther topics\n\n### Files that will be \"locked down\" (changes reviewed)\n* do not change these file names: file names that get linked to (this will be kept to a minimum)\n    - my-polling-location-hours\n    - my-election-office\n\n### Overriding county specific content\nEx. Register to vote\nname file\n\nregister-to-vote-county.ca.county_id.jade\n- for now use the name of the county in the file, and we will make a lookup tool to get the county id.\n\n\n\n\n### Image style guide\n\n### Administration and publishing workflow\nFor now, the page templates are all set up, and are in a Dropbox folder which will be synced with a git repository in a private Bitbucket account.\n\n### Spanish translation\nContent in the 'es' folder should use the structure of the en folder as a model. After we determine what content goes in the voting guide and copy edit it to an appropriate reading level, we can translate it. It would be great to have a translator get familiar with our system as early as possible.\n",

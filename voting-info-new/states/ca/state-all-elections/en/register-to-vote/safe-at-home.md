If sharing your address could put you in a life-threatening situation then you may qualify for the [Safe At Home](http://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/) confidential address program.  
- Victims of domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault are able to use a free P.O. box instead of their home address to help them maintain their privacy when receiving first-class mail and registering to vote.  
- Safe at Home registrants can receive their voter information and sample ballots at this P.O. box.  
- While in the program, participants are required to vote by mail.   

Please do not apply to register to vote using the Secretary of Stateâ€™s online registration site. Contact the Safe At Home program toll-free at (877) 322-5227 or using the [Safe At Home email](http://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/contact/email-safe-home/).

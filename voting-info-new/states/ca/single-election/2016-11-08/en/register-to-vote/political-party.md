You may either register as a member of a political party (Republican, Democratic, Green, etc.) or you may choose not to state a party preference. Your choice between registering as a party member or as a no-party-preference voter may affect whether or not youâ€™re allowed to vote in a primary election to choose a candidate to run for a political party in the general election.

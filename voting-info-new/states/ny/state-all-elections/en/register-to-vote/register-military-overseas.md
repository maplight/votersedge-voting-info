If you are serving in the U.S. military, you, along with your spouse and any dependents of voting age living with you, may register as a military voter in the state of New York. This means you will be able to receive an absentee ballot for all federal, state, and local elections in which you would be eligible to vote based on your residence in the state of New York.  

**To register as a military or overseas voter, please refer to the following instructions:**  
- **You must complete a [Federal Post Card Application](https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca2013.pdf)** to register as a military voter and return it by mail to your local [board of elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html) in New York. **This application will also serve as your absentee ballot application** for the next two federal general election cycles.  
- If you are registered but your address changes, including if you move back to your U.S. residence, you must contact your local board of elections and inform them of the change to receive your absentee ballot.  
- In addition the above link, you may request a Federal Post Card Application from your Voting Assistance Officer on base. You can also visit the [Federal Voting Assistance Program Website](https://www.fvap.gov/) or the [Military and Overseas Federal Voting Website](https://newyork.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/home.htm) for forms and further information.  
- When you register and apply for your ballot, you may specify the format in which you would like to receive your ballot (i.e., mail, fax, or email). If you select the online ballot delivery option, you will receive an email directing you to the state of New Yorkâ€™s [ballot delivery site](https://ny.secureballotusa.com/NY_loginSelection.action), where you can access your ballot.  
- If you have any questions about registering to vote, you can call the New York State Board of Elections at (518) 473-5086 or the Federal Voter Assistance Program at (800) 438-8683. You may also contact your U.S. Embassy.

If you are a victim of domestic violence in the state of New York and you are concerned about the security of your personal information, **you may obtain a court order from the New York Supreme Court in your county to have your voter registration record kept separate and not be made available to the public** for inspection or copying. Only election officials acting within the scope of their official duties will be able to access your voter registration record.  

**You may also request a special ballot so you do not need to go to your polling place on Election Day.** Contact your local [board of elections](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html) to find out more about their procedures for confidential registration and special ballots.

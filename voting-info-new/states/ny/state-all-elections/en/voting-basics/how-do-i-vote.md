## How do I vote?  

When you arrive at your designated polling place, sign in and get your ballot and voting instructions from a poll worker. Make sure to mark your ballot completely, according to the instructions.  

If you have a paper ballot, make sure to turn your ballot over! There may be candidates or ballot measures to vote for on the other side.  

Only vote for one person per office, unless instructed otherwise. For some offices, your ballot will say “Vote for any TWO” or “Vote for any THREE.” **Read your ballot carefully** so you do not overvote or undervote.

## How do I vote for a write-in candidate?  

If you wish to vote for a candidate who is not listed on the ballot, you may do so by completely filling in the oval on your ballot in the area provided for a write-in candidate and writing the name of your preferred candidate in the space provided.  

A write-in candidate for president or vice-president must file a certificate of candidacy with the New York State Board of Elections. You may ask a poll worker for a list of certified write-in candidates for these offices. Write-in candidates for other federal or state offices do not have to submit any filing paperwork; therefore, you may write in any name for these offices.

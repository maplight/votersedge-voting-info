## Am I entitled to voting assistance?  

Poll workers at your polling place are ready and prepared to help you cast your ballot, should you require instructions on how to complete your ballot. If you need help because you are disabled or cannot read the ballot, federal law permits you to have a friend, a relative, or a poll worker assist you in the privacy booth. (See [My Rights as a Voter](#section-rights-as-a-voter) for more information.)

## What if I am not on the voting rolls at my polling place?

If your name is not found in the voter book when you sign in to vote, make sure you are signing in at the correct polling location. A poll worker will be available at your polling location to assist you in determining which district you live in if you need assistance.  

Once you confirm that you are at the correct polling location, if you name is not on the voting rolls and you believe that you are eligible, you can still vote. Ask a poll worker for an affidavit ballot, and follow the instructions. After the election, the board of elections will check its records, and your vote will be counted if youw ere eligible to vote. If not, you will receive a notice that you were not eligible to vote, as well as a voter registration form for future elections.

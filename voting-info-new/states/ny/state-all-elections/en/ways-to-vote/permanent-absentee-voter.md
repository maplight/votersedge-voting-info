## Can I become a permanent absentee voter?  

If you have a permanent illness or disability, you have the right to receive an absentee ballot for every subsequent election without re-applying. Check the box marked “permanent illness or physical disability” on your absentee ballot application. You will automatically receive an absentee ballot for every election in which you are eligible to vote.

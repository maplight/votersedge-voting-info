**If your preferred candidate’s name is not on the ballot, you may cast a write-in vote** by writing the name of your candidate of choice on the blank line provided at the end of the list of candidates for any office. A write-in vote will only be counted for a candidate who has filed an “Intent to be a Write-in Candidate” with the election authority. The election judges will be provided with a list of qualified write-in candidates.  

Note that you do not need to spell the write-in candidate’s name with total accuracy, as long as it is close enough for the election judge to determine your intent to vote for a specific write-in candidate.

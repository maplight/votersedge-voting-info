A **military voter** is a member of the U.S. Uniformed Service currently on active duty. This also includes the following:  
- Any family members or dependents of voting age accompanying the active duty service member  
- Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, Merchant Marine, Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  
- U.S. Government employees serving outside the U.S.  

If you meet one of the above qualifications, you may register to vote and request a vote-by-mail ballot by following these steps:  
- Download a [Federal Post Card Application](https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca2013.pdf) (FPCA) or request one from your [local election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx), and submit the completed form by mail to your election authority. **You must submit an FPCA to your election authority every year and whenever your mailing address changes.**  
- A spouse or dependent who is registered to vote may register you in lieu of the official FPCA.  
- **To receive a vote-by-mail ballot,** your local election authority must receive your FPCA no later than 10 days prior to Election Day.  

**Overseas voters** are grouped into the following two categories:  
- **Citizens of the U.S. temporarily residing outside the territorial limits of the U.S.** This includes any civilian citizens of the U.S. who maintain a residence in Illinois and intend to return. It also includes their spouses and dependents of voting age who are residing with and accompanying them.  
- **Non-Resident Civilian Citizens.** This includes any civilian citizens of the U.S. who reside outside the territorial limits of the U.S., had maintained a residence in Illinois immediately prior to their departure from the U.S., are not registered to vote in any other state, and whose intent to return to Illinois may be uncertain.  

If you fall into either of these categories, you may register to vote and request a vote-by-mail ballot by following these steps:  
- Download a [Federal Post Card Application](https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca2013.pdf) (FPCA) or request one from your [local election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx), and submit the completed form by mail to your election authority. **You must submit an FPCA to your election authority every year and whenever your mailing address changes.**  
- If your local election authority receives your FPCA no later than 30 days prior to Election Day, you will receive a vote-by-mail ballot for local, state and Federal offices. If your FPCA arrives less than 30 days, but no later than 10 days, before Election Day, you will receive a vote-by-mail ballot for Federal offices only.

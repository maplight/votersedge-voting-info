**If you are a U.S. Uniformed Service member on active duty,** there are two ways for you to vote:  
- You are allowed to vote in person at the designated [polling place](http://www.elections.il.gov/VotingInformation/RegistrationLookup.aspx) for your permanent residence in Illinois, even if you have not registered to vote.  
- If you have registered to vote and applied for a vote-by-mail ballot, your ballot must be postmarked no later than Election Day and received by the [election authority](http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionAuthorities/ElecAuthorityList.aspx) within 14 days after the election. (See [How do I register to vote if I am in the military or overseas?](#item-military-overseas))  

**If you are a civilian citizen currently overseas,** you must apply for and submit a vote-by-mail ballot, postmarked no later than Election Day and received by the election authority within 14 days after the election.

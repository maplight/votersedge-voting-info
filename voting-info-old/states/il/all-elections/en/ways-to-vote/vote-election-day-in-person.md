On Election Day, the polls are open from 6 AM - 7 PM. If you did not vote early or apply to vote by mail, you must vote in person at your [polling place](http://www.elections.il.gov/VotingInformation/RegistrationLookup.aspx) during these hours. Once you arrive at your polling place, follow these steps to obtain and submit your ballot:  
1. **Sign an application for your ballot.** An election judge will determine the ballot on which you are qualified to vote, initial it, and direct you to a voting booth. In a Primary Election, you will be required to ask for the ballot of the party in whose primary you wish to vote.  
2. **Mark your ballot.** Each jurisdiction in Illinois uses its own voting system from among the systems approved by the Illinois State Board of Elections. Follow the instructions to mark your ballot fully, and remember that you are entitled to receive instruction on use of the voting system from the election judge. Pay special attention to the number of candidates to vote for in each office.  
3. **Check your ballot.** Double-check that you have chosen the candidates you intended to vote for and marked your ballot according to the instructions.  
4. **Cast your ballot.** Follow the instructions to submit your completed ballot either electronically or by taking your ballot, in a security envelope, to the election judge to add to the ballot box.

The state sells bonds to investors and agrees to repay the investors, with interest, over a certain number of years, somewhat like a mortgage.  \n\n**Why are bonds used?**  \n\nProjects such as roads, school building, prisons, parks, office buildings, and housing for veterans involve large dollar costs, and are used over many years.  The use of bonds helps to fund the initial large dollar costs, which are hard to fund out of day-to-day operating revenues.  Also the repayment of these bonds over time means that future taxpayers who benefit from the facilities will help to pay for them.  \n\n**What types of bonds does the state sell?**  \n\n- General Obligation Bonds  \n\tThese are the most common type of bonds, and are largely repaid from the state's unrestricted general tax revenues. These bonds have to be approved by the voters, and their repayment is guaranteed by the state.  \n- Revenue Bonds  \n\tThese are repaid from a designated source, such as bridge tolls. Revenue bonds do not require voter approval and repayment is not guaranteed by the state.  \n- Lease-Revenue Bonds  \n\tThere are repaid from lease payments by state agencies using the leased facilities. Lease-Revenue bonds do not require voter approval and repayment is not guaranteed by the state.  \n\n**What are the direct costs of bond financing?**  \n\nThe state must repay the principal of the bonds over time to the investors until the bonds are fully paid off, plus annual interest costs. The interest cost of repaying bonds depends on the current interest rate and the time period over which the bonds are to be repaid.  \n",

This makes it possible to elect local officials by majority vote without the need for a second run-off election.\n\n**How ranked-choice voting works**:\n- To start, every first-choice selection is counted. Any candidate who receives a majority (more than 50%) of the first-choice selections is declared the winner.\n- If no candidate receives more than 50% of the first-choice selections, the candidate who received the fewest number of first-choice selections is eliminated.\n- Voters who selected the eliminated candidate as their first choice will have their vote transferred to their second choice.\n- The votes are then recounted. If any remaining candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, they are declared the winner.\n- If no remaining candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, the process of eliminating candidates and transferring votes to the next ranked candidate is repeated until one candidate has a winning majority.\n\nFor more information on ranked-choice voting, check out [FairVote California\u2019s](http://www.fairvoteca.org/) video in [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J0nweMxz4g) or [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzDr6-dtQmY&t=23s) and their info cards in [English](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fairvote/pages/10300/attachments/original/1523379921/RCVCard2018-EG-FV.pdf?1523379921), [Spanish](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fairvote/pages/10300/attachments/original/1523379921/RCVCard2018-SP-FV.pdf?1523379921), and [Chinese](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fairvote/pages/10300/attachments/original/1523379920/RCVCard2018-CH-FV.pdf?1523379920).

The state sells bonds to investors and agrees to repay the investors, with interest, over a certain number of years, somewhat like a mortgage.  \n\n**Why are bonds used?**  \n\nProjects such as roads, school building, prisons, parks, office buildings, and housing for veterans involve large dollar costs, and are used over many years.  The use of bonds helps to fund the initial large dollar costs, which are hard to fund out of day-to-day operating revenues.  Also the repayment of these bonds over time means that future taxpayers who benefit from the facilities will help to pay for them.  \n\n**What types of bonds does the state sell?**  \n\n- General Obligation Bonds  \n\tThese are the most common type of bonds, and are largely repaid from the state's unrestricted general tax revenues. These bonds have to be approved by the voters, and their repayment is guaranteed by the state.  \n- Revenue Bonds  \n\tThese are repaid from a designated source, such as bridge tolls. Revenue bonds do not require voter approval and repayment is not guaranteed by the state.  \n- Lease-Revenue Bonds  \n\tThere are repaid from lease payments by state agencies using the leased facilities. Lease-Revenue bonds do not require voter approval and repayment is not guaranteed by the state.  \n\n**What are the direct costs of bond financing?**  \n\nThe state must repay the principal of the bonds over time to the investors until the bonds are fully paid off, plus annual interest costs. The interest cost of repaying bonds depends on the current interest rate and the time period over which the bonds are to be repaid.  \n"], "ways-to-vote": ["---\ntitle: \"Vote by Mail\"\npublished: false\nweight: 2\nsection: \"ways-to-vote\"\npriority: \"Minor\"\n---\n\n\n**Request** a vote-by-mail ballot from your [County Elections Office.](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/county-elections-offices/)\n\nMake sure that you send in your request so that it\u2019s received by your county elections office _**no later**_ than 7 days before the election by 5 PM.   \n\n**Follow the directions to fill out your ballot and envelope.**  \n1. **Mark** your vote-by-mail ballot.\n2. **Place** the vote-by-mail ballot in the special envelope provided by your county\u2019s election office.\n3. **Fill out** the information on the envelope.  \n\t**Don't forget to sign** the back of the envelope.  \n    **Seal** the envelope.  \n4.

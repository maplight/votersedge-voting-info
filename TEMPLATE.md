Each section has its own file, in the markdown (.md) format.

These are markdown or simple HTML files, and each file includes a simple header that controls the publishing status, order and title. We are using a method that some publishers have adopted, which is a "CMS-free" static publishing method. We have a system of content editors and reviewers who will give the final OK on content to be published and translated.

### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple language for formatting text for the web. It uses simple formatting like **this should be bold** to write. Here are the formatting tips. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

If you would prefer to use a tool that will format it for you with a button, this free-online tool that allows you to write markdown formatted text. https://stackedit.io/editor 


All you really need to write Markdown is a text editor (*not microsoft word!*)
There are other tools such as Mou, Retext.
